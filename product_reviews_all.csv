review
Like walking on Nike Air. So comfortable I love them.  Just check how many times i have ordered them.   There is only one NIKE.
The sneakers feels like walking on the clouds.  I am extremely happy with them.
"I have had these shoes for about a year now. I used them for running, workouts, and for general use. I am size 11.5 in women's and I ordered them in that size. They fit perfect and I would definitely order them again. They are just starting to get tiny wear holes in them great durability. 10/10"
"I love everything about them, except the fact that they are a little stiff around the top and I am having a little difficulty breaking them in.  They are hurting my right ankle on the inside but I am sure once I break them in they will be fine. I have had a lot of Nike shoes and this is the first pair I have had a problem with… of course, they are the first pair of court shoes I have had so that might be the problem. I always buy a size 9 in Nike shoes even though I generally wear an 8 1/2. I have tried to wear an 8 1/2 in Nike, but they are too short ."
These are super versatile. They complete many different outfits
I wear them to work on dress down days
Great fit and very comfortable. The extra support and cushioning give me extra stability when walking long distances or carrying heavy loads. I have very weak ankles and these have alleviated alot of the associated discomfort. Helps that they also feel well made with detailed construction making them more tasteful than most dad shoes.
Love these Nike trainers. I wish I had sized a half size down though. Shoe sizes are confusing now though. I am a 5 in Dunks but I would have been better with the 4.5 in the P-6000
"Definitely size down a half size or even a full size i had read the reviews and opted to size down from a 6 to a 5.5 but will but a 5 next time and im always usually a 6 , surprisingly lightweight and breathable and lovely colour way and very fashionable love them"
Absolutely love them! Probably going to get another pair.
"Very nice shoe,this is my 3rd pair, a little tight at first but they do loosen."
This sneakers is wonderful for my outfits. I can use them for multiple occasions.
"Absolutely hands down the BEST shoes I have EVER owned. They were so comfortable right out of the box and I get so many compliments on them. I am going to continue getting these exact pair so I hope Nike never stops making them. My feet tend to be wider then most, so I sized up by half, I think that was the right call."
Very comfortable and my go to walking shoe.  I love the blue/purple combo. Cushiony soft feel.  Runs true to size and just feel good on my feet.
Absolutely loved wearing it throughout my US Trip. Super comfy and fits perfectly in my feet.
Super cute! My daughter is loving her shoes!
These sneakers are super comfortable but they don’t stay white. Mine have turn yellow especially the rubber part. Very disappointed with Nikes quality. These are the second pair of sneakers i have in white that rubber part turn yellow.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] True to size and comfortable. Easy to slip on and off.
"I like this , it’s beautifulbbdbbdbdbdbbdbddndndndndd"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Everything is outstanding!!👍🏿 I will most definitely be back 👍🏿
I got my Order in Time The Shoes Look The same as the picture of Course I'm happy with this order good product
"Cómodos, good cushioning & style, modernized."
"I’ve been Pegasus loyal since high school track, liked the look of these and wow, so comfy! I cannot get over their lovely combination of supreme cushion, support and lightness, all in a sleek, low profile. Really happy with my purchase."
"The shoes are well cushioned, and I appreciate the outsoles overall. I also like the wider toe box and wish that Nike would make their racing shoes as wide as these. The uppers could be better, as my heel slips in them, but they are breathable. That said, I would not use them racing or anything like that. They perform well enough as a nice pair of training/recovery shoes, as they offer enough comfort. If you are looking for a pair shoes that are light in terms of weight, look elsewhere because these are quite heavy. My pair sometimes hurt the upper part of my left foot near the top lacing area, but gets a little better when I mess with lacing, or loosen them up. I do wish the laces were a little more stretchy, as that might help with the slight discomfort. I have ran some half-marathon distances in them (Strava - 59684519) and they seem to hold up well."
I love ❤️ these bb sneakers. I think it was mentioned before traction is bananas!🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌 Beautiful color way that screams Spring. If you like to feel loaded the ground and supported locked into your shoe or like these if you like to feel like nothings on your foot you won’t like these. I hope that Help. The JA 1 Does run a bit snug you might want to size up if you like a little more room.
"I love the overall look of this shoe, but it runs painfully small. I had to return it. I would size up."
"I bought these about 5 or so months ago and I LOVE them. Super comfortable and light weight. My only problem is that I need a different insole for my feet and I can't put one in because the original insole is glued to the bottom, and when I try to use my other one on top it hurts my feet because there is not enough space."
"These shoes are supah fly! Love the green glows. Really quality craftsmanship. So sharp looking! Comfortable, too."
"People slept on these, material, craftsmanship is 100% solid. Colorway is on point and specially the story of this specific pair. Thank you Nike/Jordan Brand for bringing these bad boys back! Being an OG head like me, We really appreciate every pair that has story behind it not just what all these “New sneakerheads” trying to hype. Well appreciated Nike Team!"
Love the colors
Very pretty pink. My daughters love them so now I have to buy 2 more pair 🙄
love these shoes the color is so bright and pretty.
Very cute .. stylish . Went great with my outfit… transaction was smooth

"I have never had a pair of Air Jordan's before and I love them. I bought these in the black and white, I also bought the ""Jumpman MVP"" ones in men's as well. They are so comfortable and such amazing quality. I wear a size 8.5 in women's and I got a size 7 in both pairs sense they are men's and they perfectly. I'm a lesbian but I'm not girly I'm more masculine so air jordans are definitely my style."
Listen..when I tell you ..the green glow is slept on...it is sleeeept on...great shoe! Must cop
Very comfortable shoe fit for all type of event.
These shoes are so comfortable and amazing in person. They feel really good on the feet. Only downfall is getting your foot in them the first couple times but after that it’s like putting a sock on. Highly recommend
"They seem cheap and poorly made, tough to break in and plastic like they are knockoffs. Terrible since they look so nice."
One of my shoes was smaller than the other taking them back to exchange very disappointed
Had to add these to my collection as soon as they dropped.  Wasn’t a purple fan until I picked these up.  Classic and comfortable as usual on the dunks.  Fit true to size!
My first ever Nike's! These shoes are more yellow in real life but the purple contrasts the color making it appear whiter. Very neat and fitting. I love them so much!!!
"I’ve always been an AF1 girl (I have 6 pairs different colors), but just purchased my first ever Dunks in this color and I love how much lighter it is compared to AF1. Thinking about buying one more as the other one I’m eyeing that was in big kids size White/Light Iron Ore/Gum Light Brown/Smoke Grey is sold out in my siz 😭. Anyways, this color will do and love that it’s not too bright."
"LOVE THESE SNEAKERS! I am in typically in between 6.5 and 7 in Nikes. I went with the 6.5 and am glad I did. They are narrow, but definitely not undersized. I have a good 1/4-1/2 in in the toe."
"I absolutely love these shoes. They are a little narrow but nothing uncomfortable. Nike shoes always fit me big. I am normally a size 5.5/6 so I got 5.5 & these fit perfectly. If I got a 6, I'm sure they would be less narrow. But I'm okay with a little squeeze. I love these shoes so much, I got the blue ones also."
These sneakers are so cute and comfy but I do not recommend these sneakers if you have very wide feet.
I don’t need to tell you about the high quality of this product. However I will tell you this is my daughter favorite pair of shoes. She would sleep in them if she could.
Look really nice in person. Pictures don’t do them justice. Glad I took a chance and got them.
"I love this shoes,  the color is perfect 👌"
This shoes are so underrated this shoes are so nice and they feel really good.The calor way is just simple and easy to match.K love this shoe
I love 5’s but this color hard to keep clean this a one time wear shoe because when it stains it’s there. Other then that Love Them
Good product...nice color ...size is so good ... and it will useful..🥰🥰🥰
I love them they look better in person I can’t wait to wear them
Love these silver low J1s!! They're my favorite pair so far. They are super stylish and go with any outfit.
This is a super cute shoe. However I am very disappointed in the creasing of the shoe. I wore them one time and they creased so bad. Too expensive to have crease marks after one wear.
"When it was time to replace my Metcon 4, I bought both Metcon 5 and Metcon 4 in the same size at the same time. Metcon 5 is a lot roomier overall but more so in the toe box area. I prefer the Metcon 4 as it gives me the stability I need for both cardio and strength exercises I do. Please do not discontinue Metcon 4."
I was skeptical about these and if they would actually make a difference. The stability they give and support is absolutely amazing. I’m so impressed I sad I waited so long.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love the color and very comfortable. Would recommend this style shoes for workouts!
"Everything goes with this shoe, feels great."
"Great Shoe!
Stylish, elegant, and sporty!
Both my boys have this style for over a year and keep on getting them this model constantly.
You won’t regret if you purchase it."
"This Nike shoe never go wrong with some elegant clothes, they fit perfectly fine , I love them they very elegant and sport shoes at the same time , classic and clean"

Very cushiony. Great grip on the road. But awful heel slip. Runs 1/2 size too big and absolutely killed the arch of my foot as well as the inside and outside of my feet. I have a narrow foot and these just were not it for me. Literally could not finish a 2 mile run and had to take them off to get back home. I wanted them to be great. They are pretty!
This shoe has lots of cushion. You don’t feel the impact while running or walking. The reason I don’t give it a 5 is because of the slippage on the back of the heel and it doesn’t give me lots of ankle support.
Nice shoes it is and it's very comfortable
Very comfortable and shape is on point.  Air Max 1s are my fav Nike casual shoe for the versatility and shape. The Max Air heel unit is comfy and the forefoot is nice as well ( not sure if there is an Air unit up front or not).
Love this shoe! Very comfortable!!
"Nike always comes through with color and style, and the Air Max 1 is one of my faves. I had been looking for a shoe with these colors and as usual, Nike came through!"
"My 6 year old nephew loves Nikes and loves red, unfortunately these low tops were a bit burgundy. He didn’t like them until we convinced him-they were a little off-red."
I like everything about the shoe
"Nike always the best, love nike products"
Runs small. Order half size up!
Outstanding Quality and Design
They fit great. And I love them. I shoes them to a friend and he ordered them.
You have to size up I’m an 8 and need 8.5. Just be aware
"Super cute and versatile! I had to size up because they run small. A bit narrow but if you size up, you should be okay."
"I received a lot of compliments on these. They look really good in person. They are very comfortable, order your normal size. I wore them to work for about 8 hours walking throughout the day and they did not hurt my feet at all."
"Great shoes, really comfortable."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love these shoes. I needed a pair that were nice enough to wear to work but have the cushion of a tennis shoe. The flexible sole is super comfortable.
"Was looking for a comfortable walking shoes. 
These shoes are great!"
My grandkids loved the shoes. I just ordered some more.
My daughter loves them and they are very stylish on the eye. 👌🏾😎
My daughter love it and wear it everyday.
"I have worn this particular shoe for years.   I have had the black/silver, the red/white, the white/white, the silver/white, the black/white, currently have the white/black and just received the white/blue.  I love love love this show.  fits my foot better than any other shoe I have had.   I will be sad if they quit making this particular one."
The shoe doesn’t fit me well.  The heel slips and even when I tie it tight my heel slips with each step.  Super disappointed .
"Love these trainers, they fit perfectly and are so comfortable. Excellent value for money."
"I have never had a pair of Air Jordan's before and I love them. I bought these in the black and white, I also bought the ""Jumpman MVP"" ones in men's as well.

"""White Nike Air Force trainers are my new favorite. They look clean and stylish, go with everything, and offer all-day comfort. The classic design and versatility make them a must-have in my wardrobe. These sneakers are not just fashionable but also easy to clean, making them a practical choice for any occasion."""

Listen to other reviews and go up 2 sizes! My son is in 5C but will probably be in 6c soon. I purchased a 6C and most of his heel was hanging off the back. Reordering an 8C because they are too cute and super easy to get on!
These are really nice but runs a little small.
"I’m so happy that Nike had this in stock and available for my baby , can’t wait for my baby to explore with the new sandals in the water."
Clean n crisp. Very durable shoe that can be used for nearly every look you choose.  Dress it up or down these classics go with everything all seasons.
The new easy on are a life saver literally no more re lace every time I go buy forces I mean ofc when I need a quick pair from the stores unless they put easy on in stores to what would be pretty cool but I have no idea but nice cheap good fashion looking shoes go with most outfits and also big big big thing I would do also is get shoe insoles for long days @ work or date night walk around comfy please
Fits well I love it

I love these shoes bought them for my daughter and she also loved them
Bought them for my girl she loves em. Really good colorway.
"These were on my 2 year old nephew’s birthday gift wish list, and he looked so happy opening the shoe box. He immediately wanted to put them on. Quality shoes, good fit. Closed toe to protect little toes but open in just the right places to make them a breathable summer shoe. You can’t go wrong with black. It matches everything. Price was reasonable too."
I bought these for my 12 month old granddaughter and she loves them
Great summer shoe for babys
"These shoes are gorgeous looking and very comfortable. I am ordering another pair in orange, in the women's shoes. My foot is narrow in this shoe, so I haven't an issue with the width. I do have balance issues, due to medical...However, I'm able to walk and stand in these shoes without any problems. They are beautiful and bouncy, for lack of a better word. I have been wearing Nike's for the past 35 years and I love them. I highly recommend them to everyone. The sizing is spot on and they are very light weight. Like a feather!"
"Fast shoes!! A tiny bit narrow but still great. Love the bright colors, they make me want to run faster!! I’d buy them again."
"This is the best pair of racing shoes I've ever owned. I've been a runner since middle school. I ran in college, burned out, and took a few years off. When I got back into running in 2022, I didn't know what shoes were cool and what to do for racing. I train in HOKAs and have a pair of their carbon plated shoes. I bought these to run my first ever marathon and they lived up to the hype. I did a training run the week before in them to break them in. I trained hard for this race, but these shoes have a lot to do with my Boston marathon qualifying time. I would recommend to any serious runner looking to run faster in races. They are insanely light with great responsiveness and they didn't hurt my wider feet."
"I absolutely love these shoes,  these are a must have for your sneaker collection. There very comfortable and I've gotten alot of compliments."
My favorite Jordans to purchase are the Mids! I absolutely love this color and they are so comfortable to wear. Also true to size for me.
This is my second pair.I get so many compliments! Love the color combination.
"Amazing, so comfortable I wear them almost everyday they are so comfortable"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very low quality but priced match. So I liked that
"I bought them for heavy lifting. Great shoes, no complains."
My son loved these sneakers 👟 he got the perfect outfit for them. Nice fit too. Perfect size.
I can't really say anything bad about Jordan brand.
I got these shoes for my son and they fit & look so good on him. They match all of his outfits. I definitely recommend these for kids or adults
"Very girly. I love the soft pastel. Perfect for Spring.

The dunks can be dressed up or down. I rocked these with a pair of Barrel jeans and ruffle shirt on Easter Sunday and they were perfect for the occasion.

The only down lapse to the dunks is the toe bed seems a tad narrow and I wear regular width shoes. Otherwise I’d give these 5 stars"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These shoes are comfortable. I can match them with a lot of my clothes.
I absolutely LOVE these dunks the quality and color.. I wear sz 8 and they are very comfortable
"Love this show comfortable and stylish, love the cream laces and bottoms"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’m in love with them and the color came out just like the picture
10/10 I love these shoes can't wait to wear them
"I have run in more than 30 pair of Nike ""go fast"" shoes (4%, next%, vaporfly, alphafly, etc.) since 2018 and have appreciated all of them for various reasons. I have typically also gotten great mileage out of each model and version.  Typically, more than 300 miles.  Except for the Alphafly 3's   Both shoes are fraying on the upper outside heel area to the left and right of the pull-on strap.  This is after 25 miles.  I have a running buddy and hers are doing the same thing.  Fast shoes while they last.  Have a second pair still in box.  Will definitely be using these only for PR or BQ races."
"Absolutely Awesome… every run in these I have gone further, faster and had fresher legs afterwards! Which really is what these shoes are all about, they are genuinely so much fun you just want to keep running! The only annoying thing is that none of my other shoes feel quite so good now I’ve got these 😂"
"I absolutely LOVE Alphaflys, but this version is unfortunately much worse than the earlier ones. I ended up having to return them which is nuts because they're my favorite shoe. They removed some of the fun bounce from before that was saving my knees for long runs, they also redesigned the heel in such a way that it gave me terrible blisters! I tried 2 different pairs in case one had a factory malfunction. Unfortunately, same thing. Please bring back the earlier Alphafly designs!"
Exactly what I wanted and was shipped fast.
Fantastic I’m really happy with my choice good service and quality
"I loved Gucci colour just
wowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowow"
"Ordered the shoes on a Tuesday & received them on a Thursday. I was impressed with the fast shipping. They came in great condition, the box was not smashed or damaged. Super cute style for baby to match parents.  Thank you Nike."
Love it!! Super nice and true size
Got these for my daughter fits perfectly she’s gotten lots of compliments!
Great shoe. Looks good and feels wonderful
These shoes look even better in person!
Love the shoes and very comfy to wear at the golf course.
"So comfy ! Could dress it up
Or down"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great shoe you can wear with so many different outfits. They fit true to size.
"I own two pairs and about to get a third. I wear these in the street, at work and just about every where. They are so nice and not everyone owns them so they’re unique. These are so comfortable especially if you have a wider foot."
"This air max is very comfortable, it's light and very nicely crafted.."
"These nike Air Max 1bring shoes to the present time from the future.  
They are easy to clean and very comfortable 8g78"

Great shoe. Reviews said that the shoe runs small and to order a half size bigger. Shoes do NOT run small so they are a hair to long in the toe. But other than that they fit nicely.
Comfortable out of the box love these
"Great training shoe. Looks good and is very light weight in my opinion. Great for a stationary, weights or any other polymeric workout."
Perfect shoes for a perfect day 🖤🤍
"My daughter love her new Nike Dunk,"
My Sister Uses These Every Other Outfit To Add A Splash Of Touch To Each Style! These Shoes Are Great Because They're So Versatile. The Not So Great Part Is How Fast It Took To Crease Them Unfortunately.
Very narrow and ugly with the yellow foam sticking out of the tongue. They look fake.
Love these super comfortable. Very stylish shoes!!
Really cute! I love them! They fit well and true to size.
Causal wear
"Love these sneakers. They fit perfectly, don’t slip off and look awesome!!!"
This is the first shoe that I purchased for my 3 month old. I ordered a size 1 and it fit perfect on him. I purchased this shoe for photos for all 3 of my children. These shoes made their photos come out great.
Awesome shoes a little bit stetch but okay
Comfortable and love the style.  🔥
They are very nice but are narrow so I had to size up.
No reviews available
"I’m a 9.5 wide and ordered 10 because there’s no wide sizes offered by Nike. The 10 was too big in the heel, my foot kept slipping out. I would have exchanged for 9.5 but the toe box wasn’t wide enough"
TTS but definitely a bit on the clunkier side. I’m not sure what’s easy on with these shoes but they’re super cute and incredibly comfy. I wore them all weekend in NYC and no issues
"Got the purple and I love the color! I went a half size down from my regular Nike size but could have gone down a full size.  They truly are easy on, easy off.  

I just love how comfortable they are and how stylish they look!"
"As my first Jordan 1 i think they lowkey fire, I give ot a 4 tho because I decided to lace swap them with a dark green to fit the logo more"
Got this for my step son and dude really loved them
Runs small but looks very nice
This style is so cute & casual. My daughter ended up going up a half size because her feet are more wide. Other than that they’re cute and perfect for this spring/ summer season that we are coming into.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Purchased for 10-year old basketball, my son loves the fit and really likes the vibrant colors."
Good fit and color way options have gotten a couple pairs for the kiddo.
"Great trainers. Easy for daughter to slip on and off due to laziness.
Quick delivery, reasonably priced."
"A great shoe at a great price point, my lad loves them because he can slip them on and not worry about getting them dirty"

Nice colors but they crease and that's bad
These sneakers are amazing and the color is perfect. I can’t wait to rock them. I recommend
"This shoe just looks great over all! Its really easy to match and the black laces looks amazing on them but since we are talking about laces, it would be amazing if it came with red laces. But other then that its an amazing shoe and I'm thinking about buying them."
"These are probably the most comfortable pair of shoes I’ve own in a long time!! If you're a person who’s on their feet 10hrs a day, or if you’re hitting the gym for a couple of hours these are your best bet I promise you."
"I would have givin it 5 stars but
The heel collapses and makes it extremely hard to get on. Other than that they are comfortable. Also runs small. Most Nikes run small. Why?"
"Best sneaker on the market for us older women. Colors were ugly. Stick to the black and white and you will sell many of these once people try them. Please do not discontinue this so because of the soul makes the shoe in the soul is bendable and perfect for people who have a hard time finding good sheets, especially older women, I will continue to buy these until I pass away. That’s how good they are the best I have ever owned. Please do not stop making a shoe that is extremely comfortable and nobody else makes a sole quite like this one. Please do not discontinue the sole of this shoe."

"Great shoes!! Super cute and comfy for my son. He loves them! The fit is perfect and snug! If your between sizes, I'd say size up."
The shoes are really nice and my kid thinks they're comfortable. To pick up at the store customer service was fast and easy.
Super good looking shoes but seem like they run small. These are 1/2 a size larger than other Nikes we've bought our son and he says these feel small. Will likely be returning.
"Bought for myself size 11, now my son wants some. Need kid sizes"
"My 11 year old lineman loves these. He said they are bet comfortable. The color is very beautiful, they also run true to size. My son is in a size 11. Gonna purchase another pair in black but I think I will size up a half size so they can last another season."
Bought these for my son and he loves them.

"The green is such a vibrant color that stands out.  The shoes is great for walking long distances and is also very comfortable.  Also, for $120 it’s a a double win."
"Ordered this shore for my son. He generally wears a size 12 Nike shoe. I read reviews that said the shoe runs small. I ordered him a 12.5. He could get the shoe on his foot it was so small. I wore a size 11, and the shoe was too small for me. Order at your own risk."
"Great golf show, size up for the perfect fit."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Comfortable shoe, allows easier movement during play. Easier on feet with walking"
Got these for my wife. She says they’re comfy and likes the way they look.
"I have worn the Nike Pegasus most of my life.  However, I really like the Nike Vomero 17.  The cushion of the shoe is great and the fit is good.  I have a narrow foot and the toe box is a little wide for me.  Great job, NIKE!"
Horrible shoe broke after an hour of use was slipping everyone couldn’t even play baskrtvall
Bought these for my husband and he loves them - lightweight and comfortable with the wide width. It was an easy choice since he already owned a pair. The dark color is great too because it is easy to keep it looking clean.
"Shoes fit true to size, are very comfortable, and perfect for a wide foot. Would highly recommend to anyone who wants a reasonably priced athletic shoe for large feet."
"I bought these specifically for an event where I needed to be on a concrete floor for 2 days on a knee that is 2 weeks from a total replacement. They were outstanding! I felt great and was able to carry on normally after my hard floor experience. If you need the comfort and support for your adventures, give these a try!"
"Top marks for comfort and style.  They seem to run a little big.  May want to consider order a half-size smaller.  They are none too wide, though.  If you have a EE- foot, they are tight.  Not tight enough to uncomfortable, but a little tighter than you want. I have only worn them for 3 rounds, so I am hoping for a little stretch.

I have real doubts about how they will perform in dewy/wet grass.  If you play in the wet, these may not be for you."
Very similar to air Jordan sneakers but about 1 size bigger so order down a size from your air Jordan sneaker size.
Love these shoes!! So comfortable and they look great for The Masters!!
Awesome looking and the price was amazing. these shoes fit my gym lifestyle.
Such an awesome shoe. Love the colors. Durable but also flexible. I wear a size 11 in everything but I needed a size 10 1/2 for these shoes!
These things are soooooo small. I got an 11 and it matches inch for inch with a 9.5.
"Great service, an got the order faster than thought..thnkX"

"very poor quality falls apart very fast lace cap fell off hole in my spike and more developing on the other, stains socks pink when slightly wet and when dry lightly stains. These spikes work great but arent worth the money hopefully i just recieved a faulty pair. had since indoor and worn 25ish times. im a sprinter so i dont use them that much even."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These were purchased for my grandson’s track season. He loves them!!
Spikes are good! I wouldn’t recommend these spikes if you have wide feet. I am a 9.5 but i got these spikes in a 10 because they run small. Very lightweight.
"I really wanted to love this shoe. It was comfortable and i could wear it for extendable periods of time. However, it has one very fatal flaw: Within 10 days of use, I noticed scruff marks on the inner facing air bubble. They look really bad on an otherwise perfect pair of black sneakers. I purchased black soleley for the reason that dirt wouldnt show and this was a complete bummer. I returned the shoe. I would recommend that Nike redesign the plastic of the air bubble to make it less prone to scruff marks. A quick google on air max 270s shows that this is a pretty common issue and folks have resorted to all kinds of mitigations to fix it. I wouldn't expect something like this for a brand new shoe."
"As always, This is my fave style of air max and I have almost 13 of them in different colors. I needed a blus replacement and this finally was available in my size so I had to get them. BEST SNEAKER AVAILABLE!!"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased this shoe about a month ago. I absolutely love this shoe. This makes my third pair (I have them in other colors of course). They’re not only great for working out but also very comfortable as an everyday walking shoe. Go grab a pair today! They have many awesome colors to choose from. You won’t be disappointed!
"My son loves these shoes so much that we buy the same shoes every single year. From the color scheme to the durability, these shoes are perfect for everyday!!"
Bought for my son to play basketball in and he loves them
These shoes are great for playing basketball and I bought these for my son. He loves them very comfortable and very stylish at the same time.
These slides cold and comfortable #BigBlue
"If you have big feet SIZE UP, I have to return this tmrw cause they are small"
"These are not like regular dunks…. I repeat not the same…. These are wider and the tongue is longer. They aren’t horrible, but not what I was expecting.  Looking down my feet look wider than what they are, but in the mirror they are ok. Not sure if I will keep. Just keep it in mind"
"These dunks are very stylish and comfortable. I'm a size 10 in women, but I order size 9 women and size 8 in men for dunks. They seem to run big, and I have wide feet. The tongue on the TWISTS are thicker than the other dunks. The swoosh is actually raised off of the shoes at the end. The ONLY con is the green is not as dark as the picture posted."
"Bought these a couple of weeks ago. So comfy, with a cushioned sole, waterproof and feel like your walking on fresh air. True to size. I am a size 5.5."
The soul came undone within a WEEK. And not waterproof after a month
"These were very nice but I need more of an indoor gym sneaker, rather than an outdoor pair."

They arrived on time and the shoes are great. My kid loves them.
Great price for soccer cleats. My son can be very picky about his shoes and how they fit. He likes these very much and they seem to fit very well.

Prettier than I expected in person. 10/10
Very cute high top for young girl. Goes with everything.
Beautiful shoes. This is the second pair of J's that I have bought for my fiancé. They're well built and the relaxed neutral colorway goes with a ton of her wardrobe.
Very comfortable especially for diabetics with feet problems. Strongly recommend
"These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever bought from Nike. They are a perfect width for my flat feet (no arch at all). They look good. They feel good—nice plush insides. 

I only rated the shoe 4 out of 5 because the insoles started to move inside the shoe. Maybe it's because I have sweaty feet. I wear stance socks so they absorb moisture. But the insoles constantly move when I'm exercising for more than 2 hours at a time. 

I use these shoes mainly to play pickleball. I also use them for walks and lifting weights. 

Again, I love the shoes. A small bit of feedback - insoles constantly move when my feet get sweaty."
"I’m onto my 6th pair of Infinity’s (including the older models). They’re consistently comfortable. Ideal for a neutral runner, but  brilliant for those in need of stability. So much cushion for long runs. Thats generic across all models. The 4th edition carries on with this. The only complaint is the extra weight and thicker upper means they’re warmer and slower. They also run a half size small, which is unusual for Nike. Not a deal breaker at all because they’re still a fantastic shoe but I do keep a pair of the 3rd edition for an event/race."
Best shoe ever 10 10 10 10 10 across the board
"Great comfort, right to my size"
"So the age old Metcon debate of the 5s vs the 9s finally has another contender. 
As a hooper I am use to a little spring in my step but as I am in the weight lift I do need to be standing flat. Enter this shoe with the perfect amount of cushion to allow you to do all activities whilst also keeping you stable and secure under the iron. 9/10, only feedback would be that the cushion around the ankle could be a little softer. 
Keep them coming and more colour ways please!"
"Very comfortable shoe that makes HIIT workouts awesome. The toe area is not stiff for anything like Bulgarian Splits or Mountain Climbers but I don’t mind that. Sometimes in HIIT classes we are required to run and it’s not comfortable in the METCON’s. I use METCON for gym only lifting and these for HIIT. I have the bone colored pair and these and they get dirty fast doing HIIT but I have good shoe cleaner and stain repellent but I also bought the Black Pair. I really like the sturdiness and cushion, bouncy feel they have because it relieves pressure on the knees and back. Great shoe and awesome design!!!!"
1st day of practice. The shoes were very slippy. Don’t know if the soles had some sort of sheen on or what. But when we did live wrestling. I was slipping a lot. I hope they aren’t this slippery all year. I bought a pair of Nike Inflicts the previous week. They are fine.
"Very ,very please with shoes!!"
PERFECT! Great fit...nice look.
Got these in violet for my 16 month old granddaughter in a 4t. She is closer to a 3 1/2 but these fit well. Easy to get on too.
Real cute for my 16 month old granddaughter. A little heavy for her feet. Thought the shoes were lighter in weight.
Very comfortable cleats and great touch on the ball and help you with your speed.
"Bought my first pair back when the 2022 World Cup kicked off and coming from the predator edges to these, the thinner upper material gave me a closer feeling to the ball like playing barefooted and was able to finally get my goal kick technique down to a crisp"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] A recently purchased these cleats for my son that plays for an Academy team and the 1st day he wore them to practice everyone was asking him where he got is new cleats. My sin says that they are super comfortable.
"Cute and comfy a bit heavy for a toddler but very cute, I get them a size bigger so he can grow into them but no slipping off even if it’s a bit big"
Good quality sturdy toddler trainer
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My son really likes it. He likes the no shoe lace feature
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought these for my 14yr old and he loves the look, feel and comfort."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My son says the fit is nice. 
Easy to slip on & off too."

Great fit and very comfortable. The extra support and cushioning give me extra stability when walking long distances or carrying heavy loads. I have very weak ankles and these have alleviated alot of the associated discomfort. Helps that they also feel well made with detailed construction making them more tasteful than most dad shoes.
Love these Nike trainers. I wish I had sized a half size down though. Shoe sizes are confusing now though. I am a 5 in Dunks but I would have been better with the 4.5 in the P-6000
"Definitely size down a half size or even a full size i had read the reviews and opted to size down from a 6 to a 5.5 but will but a 5 next time and im always usually a 6 , surprisingly lightweight and breathable and lovely colour way and very fashionable love them"
Great job. Will order again thanks for your support.
"A true sneaker like no other. Light weight, supportive, and comfortable. Your feet will love this shoe. Highly recommend!"
Love my shoes and easy done and received
liked the shoe but didn't have ankle support and it seems like shoestrings don't stay tight
I would recommend going a half to one full size up as these shoes have a lot of padding. I can wear all day comfortably. Probably my most comfortable shoe to wear and I always get compliments for the style.
Never had shoes that made my feet so hot
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Nice shoes
Very comfortable
They run true to size."
Great shoes and good support! Go up half to one size if you have medium to wide feet.
Very good I love the colors this was for my 11 month old baby sister

Quite eye-catching on. The neutral colours go well with everything.
"I like the shoes, it’s very Confort"
I love them and I wish you guys could give me another pair because my family and I have spent countless of thousands per year on Nike items
"Ok these are way more comfy than I thought they would be. The Zoom insoles help that along with the padded and semi-stitched In tongue (a typical blazer issue is tongue slide and this stops that from happening). I’m not a skater, but wearing for everyday casual wear and these are nice."
"I purchased for my husband. 
He loves them."
"Best Everyday sneaker!! easy to wear, style and comfortable all day!"
"I wanted to like these soo much cause they look awesome and my kid loved them, but with only minimal wears the toebox threads unraveled and came apart. This happened on 2 pairs of the exact same shoes. Unfortunately there is other options Nike has that are much better with wear."
Perfect fit!
They are comfortable easy for my kids to put on and a overall nice shoe
These shoes are cute and well made. They look so good on my nephew. True to size. Well packaged and shipped fast.
The Nike logo in the shoe was gone after one day. The heel feels like it’s trying to push my foot forward with the arch in the shoe being almost on my heel for some reason. Not that my heel is in the middle of the shoe but more that the shoe is built with the arch far back on the shoe to the extent that it is on my heel. The shoe isn’t too big or too small for me. It’s just odd and feels bad.
Awesome shoe! Purchased at the local skate shop and it feels amazing right out of the box. Build quality is great. Super solid and not bulky at all. Picked up two pairs in the persian violet platinum colorway.
"Good leather, runs a lil small, a lil on the stiff side but should be good after breaking in."
I think these are great and they felt nice for route running
The comfiest shoes ever! I was determined to buy some new balance bur found these instead and i am in love.
I bought these for my daughter for work. She’s on her feet all the time. They look great with any outfit and they are comfortable
The shoe was extremely comfortable and have a very nice look to them. I got many compliments on them and would definitely buy them again.
My son says these r very comfortable and great on the price.
I love my night riders they are so comfortable they arrived really quick. I wore them with my scar face jacket went very well together. Thank you shoe palace.
Love my gray goose Jordan's fit really nice and they arrived very quick I was happy about that. Thank you shoe palace.
Love them beautiful a little slender wouldn’t be ideal for wide feet 🦶 if you have wide feet thank god I don’t lol
"Disappointed. The shoes look great and are comfortable. However, both shoes make a loud and very noticeable click when I walk or run. I’m almost embarrassed to wear them.  I’ve been wearing Nikes since the 80’s and have never encountered this. I would not buy these shoes again and don’t recommend them."
Awesome shoe. Super comfortable. I took the advice of others and got 1/2 size up. Definitely the correct move.
"I bought a pair for myself and loved them so much, I ordered a pair for my husband. I’ve got 2 more pair coming in the mail!"
Love these shoes! Great for training. Have like 3 pairs and planning to but more!
"The sneakers were a gift to my daughter . Her favorite sneakers right now , brand new , delivery was fast and no issues at all . Loved the service from
Both Nike and finishline !"
This shoe fits great great for a sporty look or a casual look
"These shoes are comfortable, I have had several pairs of these over the years. I really like the dark blue/black color combo. Would buy again!"
Stuff is good . Nike is world level brand and I always prefer it my first choice .
Best shoes ever!

I would definitely recommend them. These are super comfortable and durable.
"I thought I ordered black, but they came as navy."
Great looking pair of trainers. I use them for the gym for weight training and classes and feel great and really good support. Highly recommend for the gym or daily use.

I wear the product I love the colors and they fit well
Great shoes! Fit well and look great on foot. For sure getting another pair.
Shoes looked great. The fit perfect. The delivery time wasnt bad either. Overall wonderful experience
"I'm now on my third pair of ACG Locate (different colours).  I love them - supremely comfortable and suit a wider than average foot.  Fit is true to size.  As other people have reviewed the mesh is not waterproof, so do not wear them in the rain or snow.  I tend to wear holes in the heel fabric on most shoes, but heel protectors solve that issue.  Light and comfortable."
Really liked these but after a few weeks they started making a very annoying noise. Would not recommend.
"Really comfy fit and a very lightweight shoe. Bought these for walking to work and to take the dog out. Unfortunately, these shoes are for dry conditions only. Wore them for the 2nd time walking to work in the rain only for the water to come through the top of the shoe. Needless to say, my feet were wet when I arrived at the office. 
Didn't pay full price for the shoes but definitely not near what's described on the website."
Fits nicely my feet are relatively narrow and I could fit 6.5 or 7 in women got a youth 5
Ended up returning. Not that comfortable especially around the collar of shoes where it meets your ankle. Cute design but so so comfort.
I purchased these to match my school colors.  They are perfectly comfortable and made well!  One of my favorite pairs of shoes! Shipping was nowhere near as long as they originally said they would take.  I think they came 4 days sooner than they originally forecasted.
Show looks and fits great on my girls and they love them.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this about a month ago for my 9 year old daughter, she loves them wear them almost every day they look really good and match with almost anything, materials seems durable an they fit trhu the size"
Not even less then a month my son only wore them 4-5 time and the stitching is already coming off this is not the first time this is happening for this I would of bought some lock off. Very disappointed with the quality.
Received the ADG 4's as a gift and couldn't be more impressed. MJ's influence shines through on these shoes. The genuine leather and quality puts these on another level of style. The fit is true to size and very comfortable. Thanks to Nike for the collaboration.
Perfect!!! true to size!!! very comfortable
Very comfortable shoes at first wore them a lot. One problem though the shoe laces. I swear I tied these as tight as possible and they always ended up coming undone it was so annoying. Also the insoles over time rip apart and they constantly move around .
"Bought them for partner & both of us really pleased with them! Really comfy he said, love the colour & pattern & soles are really cool.  When we unboxed they look so much better than pictures"

"So comfortable, lightweight and breathable. Way more support and cushion than I expected!"
"These shoes are pretty hard to get on even with my narrow foot.  With the decorative band across the top of shoe Otis difficult to open the shoe wide enough to get foot in easily.  I’m also disappointed that there is not an arch support.  Although I like the shoe style and fabric, I will have to return because I will not be able to use an insert and put my foot in. CNN"
These shoes look even better in person.
These are absolutely adorable and fit TTS! My daughter loves them so much and is excited to wear them to school!
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These cleats are super comfortable, cushiony, lightweight and easy to put on."
I bought these cleats and were the best I highly recommend this
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Second time ordering these for my daughter. Great quality and worth the extra!
"Like the previous reviewer, my one shoe makes a popping noise in the black area of the upper in the toe region. It's a shame because it's a really comfortable shoe."
"1. The sneakers make a loud and unpleasant sound when walking and people passing nearby chuckle.
2. The sneakers are poorly secured in the heel area, despite on the correct size."

This is a beautiful shoe that looks as good or better in person.  It definitely runs small and has a very low and narrow toe box.
"They are even more sleek in person! I got the black/green combo and the black is like an iridescent satin, so it dresses them up a bit! These do run super small and narrow- I’m usually a 8.5/9 womens and in other lebron shoes wear the 7.5m/9w but for this I had to size up even further to 8m/9.5w."
"Wanted to love them, went through 2 purple pairs arrived with defects, 2 black pairs 1 with a defect and the other didn't hold up after 1 game, material was peeling off and had some separation on the side forefoot"
"These are the cutest most fashionable shoes I’ve ever owned. Usually don’t eear athletic shoes, but the colors caught my eye. They are beautiful and comfortable. I feel so trendy in these."
"These are so comfy and cute I went back and bought another pair, so I’d have a spare when the first pair wears out !!"
"Comfy, cute and goes with every outfit. I sized up and it fits great."

"I wear a size 8.5 Nike Downshifter so I ordered the same size in this shoe. Unfortunately, I need to return them and go up a half size. They just seem to run a bit small for me."
Shoes were like plastic! Uncomfortable and poor quality.
"I'm so glad I bought these shoes despite the negative reviews about the toe box being small!  I don't have narrow or wide feet, I have average, regular width feet and these shoes are amazing!  I bought the white/green/gold color, size 8.5 and they fit perfect and are true to size.  My regular width feet are not squeezed by the toe box, in fact, my toes have wiggle room. These are by far my new favorite Nikes!  They are extremely comfortable!!!"

"Got these for basketball and tennis for my son and they're great! He likes the shoes, they're comfy and easy for my 4-year-old to get on and off by himself."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Perfect shoes for any event true 2 size comfortable 👌 very recommended
Very comfortable! she plays basketball and they are perfect to protect the foot.
Both my kids have a pair and they wear them all the time. Comfy according to them.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great feature with no shoes strings and decent price
PLEASE BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL LACE UP AF1s THESE ARE HIDEOUS AND MY SON TAKES THEM OFF WAY TOO EASILY!!! ALL I WANT IS WHITE LACE UP AF1s AND I CANT FIND THEM ANYWHERE IM SO FRUSTRATED!!!
Very cheap quality and very wide
I got these in 6.5 for my 2 year old. He’s a size 6 normally. He absolutely LOVES them. He favours these over everything else he’s got. He can easily get them on & off himself. They are easy to clean. And they look great! He loves them so much!
My son really liked these shoes! Very stylish!
My grandson picked these shoes and they are his favorite.
My kids both requested Nike's and fell in love with these. They like how comfortable they are and wear them almost every day. They've held up well given how rough my kids are on shoes.
My kid absolutely love these sandals. They fit perfect and run true to size. The design of the sandals are unique. The fabric used on these feels very durable and expensive. What I love most about the sandals are they are so comfortable and looks very futuristic. I wouldn’t change nothing at all.
My 4yo loved these the second they opened the box. She called them fast Crocs. The material that composes the soles and body are soft and sturdy. They’re super comfortable and provide great stability while being versatile for wet conditions. Love the sleek design and versatility.
I absolutely adore these shoes for my daughter. They look so sporty and cute but the best thing about them is how fast she can put them on and how safe they are for running and playing. I love how easy they are to wipe clean after a day of play outside.
"Look, style and fit were all great. Sadly, these didn't last even 2 months before blowing out on both shoes where white toe upper is stitched into front toe box. We've had a lot of Nikes for our son, and they've all been fantastic. We'll keep buying Nike for him, but will stay far away from these ones."
Look and feel comfortable. Good purchase great quality
"My son favourite trainers. Second pair. Not too hard and he always says they are really comfortable. Great shoes for school (black option). He can easily put them on, easy to clean. I can’t fault it. Great price too"
Good grip on the floor. It moves quickly with you and allows fast reactions. I think it’s good the nike hyper set is definitely a little better. But these are good for more casual/competive play. I like how it feels on the ankles and good support as a setter.
"The sneakers 👟 look 👀 so much better in person!! The colors POP and they look good on my Grandson, Santana! I love them 😍"
My son love the shoes
Love the colors a fit
"I am ecstatic about this sneaker! I have had two children and my feet have gone through a lot after having them, they've got wider and it was so hard for me to find shoes that actually fit my feet I'm only a size 7 and normally I have to buy an 8 to compensate for the width of my foo.  This sneaker is soooo comfortable and I feel so supported in it and I feel like my feet have a true fit this is the first time!   I haven’t felt this in a very, very long time so I am very grateful! Thank you so much Nike!"
"My wife said , so  comfortable shoes and soft"
Absolutely love ❤️ this shoe! 👟 Goes with a lot!
Comfy and stylish shoe. Can be worn with a variety of clothing options.
Bought these shoes for my wife to match her outfit and she loves them! They are her new favorite pair of shoes❤️ great choice
Very comfortable and fashionable. I would recommend these shoes to my friends. I wish I could find in more colors
Great shoe for regular use on the court.
Great shoe. My 11 year old son loves these and they broke in quickly and look good. We put shoe protectant on them too and they have held up great! Good value for a nice shoe.
"Nice color, they are very comfortable and light feeling too"
"These are my favourite all weather trainers!  I bought two pair to replace an old pair I have.  One pair black and one pink.  I like the way the sock grip your heel, the cut of the train under your ankle and the width of the toe.  Perfect!"
The quality of goretex getting worse. It is not first pairs of shoes from them. But this year i bought it and in one month time of wearing my socks got wet. Disappointed ☹️….

"Love the retro look and the color combination. The shoes are extremely comfortable, like walking on clouds."
True to size and very comfy
Love this shoe. So comfortable and stylish.  My favorite air max
"The shoes will be snug at first but once broken in.  These pairs are perfect all around.  Tried other Nike tennis shoes but these are specifically designed for pickleball.  Has needed support for lateral movements, which is a plus."
"Runs really snug - usually a size 9 in dunks and other Nike shoes, these fit shorter in length a d snug in width. Order a half size up!"
Love these!!! Initially they felt kind of snug and narrow however after my first time using them I played great and they fit perfect! Would absolutely recommend
"The shoes look great and my son said they are comfortable. However, durability is terrible. I bought them at beginning of March and my middle of April the velcro has started fallen apart, and the threads are coming out, making the shoes look like they have been worn for ages. $60 for a pair of shoes that barely last 2 months is ridiculous!"
Huge hole in front after a month of moderate wear. Really disappointed.
Great shoes! Love the quality and great styling.
"Got this shoe for my 10 year old son. He is incredibly active, loves basketball, and the outdoors. This was the perfect shoe for him to play street ball, wear casually to school, even hike in. He liked the wider toe box and commented that it felt like he was walking on clouds. As a mom, I want him to wear good-quality footwear understanding how active he is and wanting to protect his feet and ankles. This shoe has done just that!"
"What a shoe.
This shoe is a marriage between fashion and function. The shoe was true to size. Although my daughter foot is wide, there were no complaints about rubbing or it being uncomfortable. The shoe was fashionable. It supports the ankles and dips and curves with grace. The colors of the shoe makes it a versatile to wear. The fabric is easy to clean and flexible. The shoe is a bit bulky, which is why I couldn’t rate it higher."
"At first glance I did not like the shoe, I thought the Jordan sign was too big and the way the back of the shoe was made I didn't like it, this is not a shoe I would have typically picked but once my son put it on with his uniform it turned out to be a great fit. The colors went perfect with his clothes and he said they were comfortable."

I ordered these shoes for long jump. They work very well and fit nicely. I beat my PR in these spikes and they feel good to jump in.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My son says they're a great fit and very comfortable. He was unsure he'd like them since these are the 1st time he's used spikes for track.
Great quality! Do the job right! Super light weight and overall excellent! I would size up a size though.

"Beautiful spike, immediately helped me break 2:10 in the 800m. However, the ZoomX foam and plastic under the air unit wear put REALLY fast. These are not spikes to throw on whenever, these are pr spikes. I also ordered true to size, and the result is a ¼ inch gap in the toes. But you can't complain too much with these things performance."
The Nike Air Zoom Victory is honestly one of my top 1 performer when it comes to Middle distance and one concern is the durability but other then that great performer.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My son is very impressed with these. He had a wide foot and we got a 1/2 size up and it’s worked well
"I will start with stating that I really like the boot and it's comfort. Also how well nike treated the situation when their(the boots) biggest issue arose. 
Now to the ugly: the lacing system. Horrible. Just plain bad. No matter how slow you lace then to reduce friction on the eyelet cords they will still just wear through. They last 4 months, nike was nice enough to send ne a replacement but the same thing happened. 

I saw they made a new version. SFB B2 they removed the rubber little squares that fall off anyway and added a pull tab. If they put regular boot eyelets on a new SFB B3 version I would give 5 stars.
-I only use these when I'm in the schoolhouse so no field work and they still failed. Still look brand new, just can't lace them."
"I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration with the Nike SFB B1 boots I purchased on 3 September 2023. As an active duty member of the US Army, I rely heavily on the quality and durability of my footwear, and unfortunately, the Nike SFB B1 boots have fallen far short of my expectations.

Having been a loyal customer of Nike for many years, I was confident in the brand's reputation for producing high-quality products. However, the recent experience with these boots has left me questioning the standards of craftsmanship and durability that Nike upholds.

Within just six months of purchase, I have encountered numerous quality issues with these boots that are simply unacceptable. Despite only using them for everyday office wear, the boots have already started to deteriorate. The lace holding component, which is crucial for securing the boots, wore through and failed due to poor construction, rendering the boots unusable. Additionally, the rubber siding has begun to detach and the seams on the sides have ripped, all after minimal wear.

As someone who relies on dependable footwear for both professional and personal use, experiencing such rapid deterioration in a pair of boots is both frustrating and inconvenient.

As an active duty member of the US Army, I expect my equipment, including footwear, to withstand the demands of my duties. The Nike SFB B1 boots have failed to meet this expectation, and I am deeply disappointed by their lack of durability and quality.

I am open to considering alternative Nike footwear options that may offer better quality and durability. However, I urge Nike to take immediate action to address the issues with the Nike SFB B1 boots to prevent other customers and Soldiers from experiencing similar dissatisfaction."
"As a member of the army I loved these boots, they felt like running shoes. However, the lace holding component that connects the shoe laces to the boot isn’t ideal. The friction between the two laces style products made the boot laces attachment rip and making the boots unusable after having them for 9 months."
"Got the product, definitely glad i went a half size up from my normal size that i go for when it comes to Nike shoes (they fit similar to vans on the length). Kinda feels tight on the width so i wouldnt recommend for wide footed people, i think it should break in fine for me once i wear it a few times though. Also, expect the packaging to be barebones and minimum with no return label included for sustainability."
"i absolutly love these, they fit well and they look great.
They are well made.. I bought them in all white also"
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased these nikes they wear so good, I purchased a second pair!!"
Awesome feel. Hoping for more color options.
"Very impressive,  feels like you're walking on clouds. Weightless. Had my wife try them on. She ended up buying a pair."
I love these shoes!! Best purchase ever!! I hope Nike continues this line and does not discontinue these. Hoka does not compare!! I bought hokas for walking if but they were not good at all they gave me feet pain all of the time. When I got these shoes and started using them my feet pain went away!!
Very nice shoes for the price it’s underestimated
"Nice looking shoe, great price point and very comfortable. Happy I purchased and may buy another pair!"
My teen loves these shoes for exercising. Comfortable. Cushion-y. Overall great show.
"I would suggest going a half size up if you typically alter between two sizes. These shoes are comfortable and very well made. The design is fresh, eye catching, and perfect for summer ❤️♥️"
"I own 7 pairs of these and I wear them at the office mostly. They have so much cushioning, I can be on my feet for hours at a time. Note, order one size higher due to the extra cushioning!"
"Furious, I never bought these sooner. They go on like slippers, once you lace them up they anchor and you know they mean business. Great traction, great support, very responsive and super light.  Well played Nike great shoe."
"Perfect shoes , beautiful , good price"
These Team Hustle D11’s were absolutely amazing for my baby boy! The fit was not too tight and we’re not too wide. Such great quality of material made on the sole of the shoe for babies when they start walking around. The detail of the basketball on the Velcro was superior! I know my son was very happy to put these on once he heard the straps come off!
"I found a mix of positive and negative aspects to consider. The fit and feel are generally comfortable, offering a nice, lightweight sensation. However, the difficulty in putting them on is a notable drawback, especially for sizes 2C, 3C, and 4C. The stiff heel tab area makes it challenging to slide the baby's foot in easily.

In terms of design, the sneakers are lightweight, sporty, and aesthetically pleasing, complementing various outfits. Nevertheless, the stiff pull tab for the heel poses a challenge, particularly given the broader shape of a baby's foot.

The fabric used is breathable and lightweight, contributing to overall comfort. However, the inclusion of a foamy sole adds unnecessary weight for a baby that isn't walking yet, making the shoes feel somewhat clunky.

Overall, I appreciate the look and feel of the shoes, but for a baby, the difficulty in putting them on and the clunky feel due to the foamy sole are areas that could be improved. I would suggest making the toe box and tongue more adjustable to facilitate an easier slip-on experience, akin to the design of the Jordan 1 crib booty."
Perfect walking shoes!!! Very comfortable and easy to slip in and out
"I am completely satisfied with my shopping experience at Nike web site, and with my Nike Go FlyEase shoes."
"I bought these for my dad who has Parkinson’s and he loves these shoes. He’s not even a big sneaker guy, but he wears them all the time. Ordering a new pair for him now he’s loved them so much."
"True fit & light weight (like Converse but w/ a thicker sole). I like the simplicity of the snaps to slide my feet in. This the 3rd colorway I purchased & yeah, I really like this sneaker style for the spring & summer. Also, a luggage spacer saver when traveling."
I love this shoe mainly because of the no laces to keep coming untied. The comfort of the shoe and the style is on point. The snap on both sides makes it more secure on your feet. Would recommend
"I don’t collect sneakers but I will purchase in another color they are comfortable and stylish. The snaps are hard to close, if you have a wide foot or thick ankles it could be an issue. Great shoe otherwise"
"The slider is great but oversized compared to other Nike shoes size down one size that’s what worked for me hope I help
The size problem is the only reason I never give 5 stars"
"Best sliders going had 2 pair of them perfect 
I’m a11 in trainers but 10 perfect in these"
Not comfortable at all so not waste ur money!! Feels like bricks in ur feet !! Very disappointed in Nike !!!
"My son loves these, they are very durable and easy to clean."
Amazing Boots My Little Niece Loved Them And They Are Super Grippy Too Buy Em Before There Gone 100% Recommended For Rainy Weather
Easy slip on boots. Loved this purchase for my 5 yr son.
"These look much nicer in person/on feet than what the pictures show. A nice update to the classic blazer silhouette, and much more comfortable than the classic. Fits true to size."

These cleats are good but the gx1 was way better they felt better and had a better design. They should bring them back
"Normally with these types of shoes, I have to buy them a little larger, about a half size up, I hadn't done that for these shoes and had ended up with a shoe that is closer to the size I wear with other shoes that fit differently. Unfortunately, they were a bit on the tighter size but they hugged my feet well. I loved how my feet looked in these! Despite the size issue, they were still slightly comfortable to wear and to use when playing on the field. The design was unlike any other shoe that I have owned. They were definitely unique and eye-catching despite not having bright colors. I liked this fabric as it was breathable and fit the shape of my foot. My favorite part was the design. I love black shoes and they are very sleek. Due to my own error, I would only get another pair that was sized up for my comfort."
"Great Comfort , all around ! The touch is wonderful!"
"I bought the Pegasus 40, but they didn’t last long as they started to breakdown about a month into wearing them. The previous Pegasus 39 shoes held up fine for 6 months except he outgrew them. So I went and repurchased the Pegasus 39 shoes."
"I love my Nike Pegs 40,  love the white & black color. They feel & fit great. I've just ordered the black & white for work. Love these Pegs! Thanks Nike!👍"
"First pair of running shoes, good value and great support"
"I ordered my normal size which is 8.5 in most all shoes. I could tell right when I opened the box these looked big, and when I tried them on I’d say they seem to be a half size too big, and now they don’t have a 8 available online. Definitely have to go back and I’ll try half size smaller. Bummer."
"These are comfortable and saved most of my money to buy these AF1S would recommend buying and my disappointation (if thats a word) i did not regret buying these. The only thing i dont like when this happens is creasing, but hey it'll happen at some point."
I love these shoes. Every year I purchase a new pair!
Great waterproof boots. Perfect for rainy/snowy school days. They keep my son’s feet dry and warm without being too bulky or heavy for all day wear
My son needed some boots for the winter everyday wear. This are great quality for the price.
I get this product for my son
"I like the shoe styling, however, I found that the sizing runs a little small."
VERY COMFY MY SON LOVES THEM
"So comfortable trainers an very smart to wear with jeans, very happy with them"
My son receives a lot of compliments while using these shoes.
I bought these shoes for my six-year-old. They are easy for him to put on by himself and they look great!
I bought these for my son's 6th birthday. He loves them!!! Literally wears them everyday.
"Comfortable, light weight, and springy. They respond with your feet almost like a trampoline. I love these shoes for in and off the court."
"I am 32 - 6'0 // 187 pounds and i can play 5 or 6 games without feeling sore the next day this is the best shoe for guys over 30 that want to take care of their knees or back , cushion is fenomenal and traction gotta say top tier i was stopping on a dime every single play translucent outsole didn't pick up dust at all and compared to the 1st model this one dosent hurt ny foot the react on the heel feels super nice and they cut the weight by an ounce"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I'm wearing them now so comfortable happy with my purchase
Very comfy but runs slightly big compared to other shoes we have purchased. 3yo son likes them a lot and they look cute too.
Bought these for my grandson at my daughter’s request. We all have a pair and love that we can match as a family!
Good quality

"These were on my 2 year old nephew’s birthday gift wish list, and he looked so happy opening the shoe box. He immediately wanted to put them on. Quality shoes, good fit. Closed toe to protect little toes but open in just the right places to make them a breathable summer shoe. You can’t go wrong with black. It matches everything. Price was reasonable too."
I bought these for my 12 month old granddaughter and she loves them
Great summer shoe for babys

"Bought 2 pairs, one for each of my teenage boys (twins).  They like to run and workout a lot and they both said that these are one of the best shoes for running.  So comfortable and durable. Year later they both still use these.  Just bought 2 more pairs for them."
it is a nice shoe but the band on top is ugly and will get dirty real quick.
I love these sneakers I run every day and these are super comfortable 💪🏽🦈

Love this shoe I have them in an another color. Perfect shoe for walking and working out so I jump when I seen them for this price.

"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My daughter loves these! Fits great, comfortable and durable. I would recommend these to anyone!"
Love the fit and look! My daughter loves how supportive this shoe is. She has narrow feet and Nike has consistently been our go to shoe for comfort.
"Excellent, light weight, and good looking shoe"
Shoe isn’t too squishy and very supportive. Kid approved!
They are good my grandchildren get these every. year
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought for my son, he loves them, would definitely recommend"
"The color way is awesome - the comfort and improvements over the Victory Tour 2's have really changed the stability for the better in these shoes.  Will definitely keep these and looking forward to getting more colors.  Stability improved, still comfortable, now good to go!"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this for my daughter she loves them good cleats
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My little athletes love their new cleats! I purchased two pair for my twins and they have raved over these shows. They particularly love the color way and have expressed that they are quite comfy while on the field! The laceless design is also a plus! Would purchase again for sure!
"These look great but after a few years they smell so bad.
Even washing them does not help.
Common problem with the mercurial shoe."
10/10 great shoes. Will buy more.
Very comfortable and softer when walk.  Also perfect size and trim around my feet.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Purchased four weeks ago. Order them twice. Easy break-in. Feel great.
Just got these today. They are so comfortable!
My son luvs em😎 he has worn them every day since they arrived.
I love these sneakers. They are very comfortable. I also have them in another color as well.
Love them I got me and my son a pair true to size too
"These shoes are extremely comfortable and run true to size.  I wanted an every day shoe that could handle any terrain, and these are 100% it.  The cushioning is great."
Very lightweight and comfy. Great fit that have been great on the trails.
Bouncy soles. Colours have a nice shimmer in the sun. Grip is solid on firm ground.

"Great shoes, easy for my son to get on and off. And look great!"
"Must say I’m really disappointed in these. I was really excited to see that they finally made a shoe for kids that opened wider. However the pictures are deceiving and make it look like they open wide. All they do is take away the fact that they don’t have to be tied (if that’s what your looking for than there great). There small and narrow, they do not make it any easier to put on. I can’t get the opening to open any wide than a regular Air Force one. I really thought they made a shoe that would work for kids with disability’s but no. Nike continues to fail on that. My son wears ankle braces and even a size up shoe can even accommodate them. Not to mention there very narrow shoes. My son’s feet aren’t that wide but boy do they make his feet look wide as well. There not any easier to put on him, even with out a brace. Nike we live in a day an age we’re all shapes and sizes and abilities are welcome yet your shoes never defer from there standard."
"Fantastic cleats, my son loves them. True to size and phenomenal quality."
"Great cleats, fit true to size. My son loves them much better than the cheaper molded ones."

Great Look and fit! Perfect for the Oregon Football season!
Disappointed with brown shoe box the shoes came in!
I really like the comfortable kicks. I’m going to change the laces to black or green. Go Ducks!!!
These shoes are comfortable to wear and decently priced
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great deal and comfortable and stylish. Goes great as a business casual look.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really enjoy wearing these sneakers super comfortable.
These sandals are so comfortable! I wish they had more colors available. They do run a little small but I absolutely love the comfort it provides!
These are light weight slides that a perfect for summer. They run a bit big so I suggest buying down a half size.
I bought these slides to take on vacation with me. Best thing I could have done. They were so comfortable And exactly what I was looking for.
"I was disappointed with this purchase. Overall they just didn’t work for me when it came to exercising or running errands. They looked nice and fit well at first but as the day went by, they just weren’t it. The sole is too bulky and my feet push forward to were it hurts."
I brought these sneakers over the weekend at the outlets in Williamsburg Virginia. I love these sneakers and the price was amazing with Birthday discount 😍 comfortable pair of sneakers
Literally my favorite shoes ever. So comfortable. Sad they don’t sell white anymore.
Fits perfect and my daughter gets plenty compliments at her basketball games.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I ordered these for myself (I am a women’s size 8) in a youth 7 and they fit perfectly. Love the style and the color way. I was impressed with the comfort. First Luka’s will not be my last!
"These trainers are so comfortable. I have 6 pairs of Luka trainers and I use them to play netball. They are so sturdy, great grip and provide really good ankle support. I get half a size bigger just because of the sudden stopping playing netball."
Amazing shoe. Super comfortable great looking. I beat 2 pairs of these up with hard use building a cabin in the woods. Lightweight too.
Super solid shoes. I have these in black and they fit so well. I did swich the laces to lock laces and it improved the look of the shoe by a lot. These pair so well with the trail pants.
"I had gotten a pair of these Christmas of 1994. Here it is 29 years later and I smiled with a jaw dropping awe you know what I had to do. I had to get another pair. And you know what else, I'm thinking about getting another pair. They are very comfortable and I want another pair so I can work in them"
"These are so comfortable! I use them on a tread & you can definitely feel the heel support. 
Would love to see these in more color options."
So far so good with these. The cushioning is very nice and makes the shoes super comfy!
These were probably the best shoe that I have ever got For my mom
Bought these for my daughter to wear for tennis. She said they are comfortable and plenty room in the toe area.
They both broke from the part that holds the laces the second time I wore them to play pickleball
They both broke from the part that hold laces the second time I wore them to play pickleball
These are great!!!
I mainly use these shoes for work which is very comfortable and also breathable
Very comfortable sneakers!
"I love love love these shoes. Super comfy and stylish. Only thing I wish is that we can customize the colors. I would love to have them in so many other colors. I'm not much for a high top shoe, so these are perfect. Please, if Converse can make them customizable .. OMG!"
"I absolutely absolutely love Love, love my new shoes!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
"I LOVE my Run Star Hike Platforms! I could never wear Converse before as I needed good arch support and now that I have these, they are all I wear pretty much everywhere. I can honestly say they are the most comfortable sneakers I've had. And super stylish too - feel so hip and cool wearing them. Two very high thumbs up!"
Loved this! very comfortable and a surely pick for those who want to look simple but elegant.
"Love, love, love! I got a 1/2 size smaller than my normal shoe size and a full size smaller than my typical Nike size.  Love the different colored swoosh and the comfort fit."
Nice price nice shoes
"I bought the Pegasus 40, but they didn’t last long as they started to breakdown about a month into wearing them. The previous Pegasus 39 shoes held up fine for 6 months except he outgrew them. So I went and repurchased the Pegasus 39 shoes."
"I love my Nike Pegs 40,  love the white & black color. They feel & fit great. I've just ordered the black & white for work. Love these Pegs! Thanks Nike!👍"
"First pair of running shoes, good value and great support"
My niece loved them very nice. Better price than normal more affordable
"I love the shoe, but they run big."
Absolutely love these shows! So comfy and the price was amazing!
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great sturdy shoes good for everyday wear. He loves them!
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great quality, easy for 9 year old to put on and tie!"
I love the color and the style of these shoes. They fit just right and semi confortable. I really loved the price when o got them on sale. Always looking for the sales.
This product was a gift.
Super stylish and comfortable. Love the look of the shoe from behind.
Super comfortable golf shoes. One of the best pair of shoes out there that have both the looks and the comfort. Only thing is they may run a 1/2 size large then compared to normal Nike brand shoes. Overall great golf shoes.

My son loves these and uses them for gym class but the durability and quality is absolutely not there. The whole shoe is coming apart after only a few months. The front has these thread like fibers that are expanded and just not up to par with Nike quality. I would suggest going with another sneaker if you’re looking for something to last a little more than a few months
"Do not recommend.  My son has worn 4 times and toe cap is completely ripping off.  Insole has also come out.   Very poorly made shoe, not worth it."
My son has worn various versions of Star Runners for years now. They are his daily shoes but this most recent pair has substantially worn away the tread in less than 3 months of wear. His previous pairs' soles were all still generally intact by the time he outgrew them (much longer than 3 months). I would be hesitant to buy another pair of these if this is the current state of durability.
"Absolutely love these. I wear Xero barefoot shoes as my daily, and previously Kobe 6’s for basketball that I just plain worn out. I tried so many shoes in my search. These are lightweight, ventilate well, and don’t have a crazy heel/toe differential which is exactly what I was looking for! Very grippy even through intense cuts on moderately dusty courts. If you were a fan of Kobe’s and can’t get your hands on them, absolutely recommend giving the Sabrina’s a try!!"
"I love these shoes. They are extremely comfortable, a little tight in the toe once you first wear them, but break in quickly. I’m a big fan of many of the colorways, and have purchased many of them. Highly recommend."
"These shoes are too tight on the toe area. Ordered them for my sons and then were too snug, reordered 1.5 sizes up and they’re still too snug. My boys don’t have wide feet at all, they want me to re order bigger but their heel will be lifting out the shoe if I do. These will be returned unfortunately. What a bummer because they really wanted to rock Sabrina’s."
"Great looking shoes, very comfortable and durable."
super comfy and lightweight. it looks super nice. super great even after a week
I like them so much got me a lot of attention during. Football season
"The cleats didn't even last me 4 months.
I bought these cleats for full price on November 22, 2023 and on March 3,2024 I realized they were already broken, I use them to play flag football once a week.
They are not worth buying for full price."
"Really tight fit. Read online that they run big so I ordered my normal size (10.5) when I normally order a half size up in everything Nike. Should've just stuck with the half size up, because these are very narrow."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These have excellent stability and traction for tennis. I love the Rafa Nadal signature Series. I got these for a great price.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great tennis shoes, it arrived in excellent condition."
Fast shipment first time buying these kinds of shoes in Nike and I absolutely love them. Very comfortable look great lots of compliments
"I love the denim design of these sneakers 👌🏽, they look good on my feet and they’re super comfortable. You did ya thang with these Serena! Lol"
Love ❤️ the style and comfortability of these sneakers.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My 9 years old loves them, he said they are very comfortable."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great little kids Jordan’s! Love the fact you don’t have to tie any laces although it looks like you do. The closure is a hidden Velcro. Really well made!
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this a couple of weeks ago. The shoe is great for kids who find it easier to strap Velcro instead of tying laces. This shoe would be better for a kid who has a wide foot
Bro i got these boots signed by cr7 at the match at al nassr they are so good for running as fast as him i run really really really fast :)

I literally feel like I’m walking on clouds. Love them. Perfect long walks at the theme parks.
Love my shoes. Fir true to size
"True to size, very comfortable and goes with just about anything."
Just the right amount of support vs cushion with memory foam. Great for walking. Highly recommend!
For lovely and super comfortable for the gym
"I rarely have luck finding running shoes but these have been perfect. Lightweight, flexible, and supportive!"

"This shoe has been amazing! With my old Vapor 9.5's, which were totally beat down after several years, I was feeling seriously abused after every match. These shoes are so much more padded and just as stable. I don't know if I'm crazy but I honestly feel better after playing with these shoes on. While the Vapor 9.5's do feel lighter and faster I feel like my steps are bigger and stronger with the GP Challenge 1. End result, I think I am faster with these shoes on than with the old 9.5's. If you're a bigger player in the 6'1"" and taller range you'll appreciate this shoe I think. I thought I was more of a size 12 in Nike but in this shoe I went with a 12.5 after trying on some shoes at a local store. In pretty much any other shoe I wear a 12 but in this 12.5 is definitely the correct fit."
"Nike can we please have a light weight sleek vapors back????? These and all other shoes for tennis are now soooo bulky, I’m trying to be fast out there y’all."
"The shoe itself is amazing. However the first time I slide on this shoe, the shoe lace socket completely broke so I do not recommend for players that do a lot of sliding"

I like this product it’s very comfortable
I bought the custom air force ones but it quickly got dirty within one wear and later I cleaned it
"Very light running shoe! For me it feels better running on soft, bouncy surfaces like a track or astroturf in these than on hard surfaces like asphalt or concrete. Also these are better worn with thin running socks than thick cotton ones as the shoe will fit true to size."
Got these for my dad and he absolutely loves them. Going to probably order him another pair in a different color.
Very comfortable worth the price
"It's a very versatile shoe I walk,run and even play ball in this shoe. I also can dress them up with a polo and jeans!"
Love these so perfect and the sizing is on point
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My girl loves the colorway great shoe 3 are very comfortable
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these for myself (size 14) my wife (size 6.5) and my son (size 4.5) and we all love the. Comfort, style, it has it all."

"Been using Nike's tactical boot since it's debut when I was in the military for OIF.  It's literally the only Nike product I buy. This new Gore-tex version is even better.  Keep it great Nike, and I'll keep buying them.  For reference when I first started using in the military; I tried Bates, Converse, Adidas and Reeboks tactical boots. I liked Nike the best, been running with them ever since."
"These boots are AWEsome! This was the first pair of boots that I purchased for work-related activities, and for the past two years they have held up great. I have also daily-ed these boots, and they are awesome just to wear around town too.

Pros: 
Very waterproof
Look Great
great traction

Cons:
As with any shoe there is a break in period so not really a big con, especially because they get really comfy after a more extended period of time spent in them.
Lots of wear on the front toes, could just possibly be my wear experience, not the boots."
runs small. ijust got the metcon 9 in size 11 and they fit perfect. So i bought these boots in size 11 and it took 5 minutes just to squeeze into them. The toe box feels a little tight. I am going to where around the house this week end and if they don't break in I will return them.
Sneakers are really cute in person! I love the designs on the shoes. Probably my favorite pair of dunks that I own and I cannot wait to wear them.
The shoes were amazing. The colors and the design were awesome . Loved the shoes a lot
Best general release dunk to date! Amazing colorway and the quality is spot on. It doesn't feel cheap. Please keep making your dunks with this type of quality!
I found them to be perfect for my daughter. The fit was perfect and are very easy to slid on and off of. The design is great as they are convenient for toddler to put shoes on and off. I liked how the black and white colors to make the shoes easy to match with outfits. The fabric is another great feature as it’s breathable for hot days. Favorite part of shoes is the easy of putting on and taking off especially as a parent on the go most of the time. I wouldn’t change a thing on these shoes.
"My child is quite the wiggle worm and the Nike Dynamo Go 2 are great for helping us get out the door in a hurry. These shoes make getting ready to leave the house a breeze with their soft stretchy fabric, easy to grab tongue, and well designed heel lock. They run true to size and seem like a great velcro and lace free option."
"These shoes are so adorable for little ones! The opening is nice and flexible, making it easy to get those stubborn little toddler feet inside. The soles are super sturdy and the width and flexbility of the shoe are perfect for my guy's chubby feet (haha). He also usually finds a way to kick off his shoes, but we haven't had that problem with these. 

We have the black and white color - material is soft and super easy to clean, and the color goes with everything. These are great everyday shoes. Easy to slip on for a quick trip out of the house or to throw on to go to the park. If you have little ones, you know how annoying it can get to have to keep retying their shoelaces. These go on and off with ease! They're our new go to shoes. We'll definitely be buying a bigger pair when he grows out of these!"
Very comfortable shoe and it’s a new ce color for the spring
Need more of these pink ones! Need to add pink to the custom design colors so we can design our on.
"These are so cute and very comfortable. They are true to size. My only complaint is the laces, you will need to order some because they don’t stay tied and they are long."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these almost a month ago, and put them on one, and they looked awful."
Shoe does not run true to size it runs small. True 8.5 need a size 9.
I would give these sneakers zero stars if it allowed that. I've had these shoes for 2 weeks and they already look and feel like I need a new pair. I always buy nike shoes especially to work out in and this is the first time I'm extremely disappointed.
"Just got my first pair of blazers this century, look great and I expected the tight fit from research but the left shoe is really tight! Someone else mentioned this is comments a few weeks ago, hopefully it loosens up a bit, must be a production issue- I love the colors and look but may loose my left foot…"
I’m a Nike Blazer fan great look and color palette very neutral for your wardrobe. Left shoe runs narrow definitely have to get them stretched and break them in not sure how that occurred.
"Great new look. Very comfortable, except one came tighter in the arch than the other so they don't quiet fit the same. I am flat footed so can easily tell the difference. Hopefully that will break in though, My Jumbo blazers did and then I loved them. Really like the style of these and they go with pretty much anything and everything. Great everyday sneaker!"
Excited about my recent purchase. Looking forward to find a matching outfit to pair with them!
"Excellent, Beautifully Classic and Clean pair of shoes that go with any outfit."
I love the shoe. It caught my eye totally. I bought them for my nephew.
I was sent a display shoe and I looked online and they still had my size so why would they send me a shoe that sits out on the shelf
Love any air max but definitely needed a all back . Comfy
"Received USED shoes. All scuffed up leather was scratched on parts of the shoes, bottom is SMOOTH where there should be grips."
These are great for golf and for wearing around.  Except for the Travis pair the Jordan 1 Golf’s are easier to get for those of us who wear their shoes.
Me personally i like the air jordan 1 high and low  golf more than the regular air jordan 1. The waterproof features and the materials are outstanding. I feel that the golf version is a stronger made long last shoes than the originals. Gold MJ’s all day for me cant wait to get the UNC pair.
"Really beautiful sneakers, both for golf and casual wear. They do run at least a half size big, depending on your feet. Personally I tried a size 12, 11.5, and 11. For me the 11 was nice and snug, but not tight, so I kept the size 11 and glad that I did."
I bought these for my son and they broke within a week.
Great color perfect fit
"They shoes fit perfectly my son is a runner so this shoe was the perfect fit for him . 
Easy to clean and wipe after a long day of playing outside for my son"
"I really love the look and feel of the shoe.  I just wish it as a little more snug - it's kind of loose around the ankle area.  Looks great and I received a lot of ""nice shoes"" from my high school students.  Comfortable enough (typical Nike Air).  Just wish for a little more around the ankles"
"Great shoes. I love these shoes, Nike's one of the best model"
My favorite pair of Nikes!  I'am 65 years old! There a reason Nike is #1customer service!
"Comfortable with a bit of arch support. Looking forward to being able to keep clean with the all-white leather. I bought the all white leather version, not what is pictured."
"I love the white on white. My only negative point is they run small and feel a bit narrow.   I can make them work with a thin sock and I wouldn’t wear them every day as they are less comfortable than other Nikes I own, but I do love this classic look and I would buy another pair"
Runs narrow and short. Size up half a size for best comfort and fit. My true size is 10 and I purchased 10.5
"Arguably the most comfortable running shoe I've worn. I picked these up after my Pegasus 39's starting wearing thin and they're a huge upgrade over the Pegasus platform. Roomy in the toe box, light, and they look pretty great as well. I wear an 11 but always go up a 1/2 size with Nike. Great shoes!"
They looked and felt great. They did run a little small so I returned them and ordered a half size larger than what I typically am.  I will have to report back after I put some miles on them.
Great shoe. Extremely comfortable and not narrow like the Pegasus line. Shoe has ton of cushion and has a great feel when running
Nike always produces good quality shoes.  But...... These were too heavy!
Slides are comfortable and stylish Perfect for after the gym or running errands around town Fast shipping to me I wear a 9 in flip flops These hug my feet perfectly May not be comfortable for people with wide feet My feet are narrow
"I bought three pairs two white and red and one black and white and intended to buy two more pairs I just love the tempo material it's a very comfortable
And I am a female you can do long distant walking in it that's comfortable they are"
"Lebrons are great shoes. I love the style and feel of them. However, they are definitely a whole size smaller than the suggested 1/2 size. Typically I wear a 11 1/2 and I had to go up to a 13."
"The sneakers are a half size small. But I gave them to my brother and he loves , how comfortable they are. I will be purchasing another pair for me 🤩"
"""Runs small"" is an understatement for this shoe. I took the advice and ordered half a size larger, but that is not it. Despite wearing 10.5 all my life and having pretty average feet, I cannot seem to get my feet into a size 11. I returned promptly and opted for a LeBron Witness 7 instead, which still runs a bit small, but doesn't suffer from the fit issue Witness 8 has. This is just incompetency in shoe design in my opinion. If not for the size problem, the shoe looks and feels nice and high quality overall."
Beautiful and stylish sandals. Adult daughter is very pleased.
Nice and came on time
I like these slides.
I am happy with what I bought from Nike
Shoe is a bit narrow like most of there other newest products
They are ok. Super tight. Won't bother breaking them in or wearing them. Hopefully in 20yrs they'll  be worth  180 bux.Wish they were more of a SB shoe instead of basketball. Their ties to the music industry is the only reason they'll be in my collection.

This shoe looks better on and fits my 5-year-old perfectly. It fits true to size and has become his new favorite for basketball.
I bought these for my grandson and it’s an awesome looking shoe
Best shoe for medium pace games.Traction is great and foot support is good.
Shoes seem to run small. Tried three different sizes to a full size bigger and they still felt short. They also need to bring back the little kids and toddler options.
"Style and construction is nice. A bit narrow in the toe, seems 1/2 to 1 size too small, suggest ordering at least 1/2 size larger."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought these for my husband for valentines and he loved them
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My child works out in these shoes with no complaints
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these as a birthday gift for my husband. He had been looking for these shoes for months. He was so excited to see them.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Overall a good shoe but a bit snug for people with wider feet.
I've worn these spikes a handful of times now and the difference they make is very impressive! Very lightweight and very comfortable. I'm a size 9 usually so went with 9½ and they fit perfectly with no socks for me. Ordered from Sportshoe and the delivery was very prompt as was the communication. Very happy customer!
Excellent shoe.  Comfortable right out of box and true to size.

"Very Comfortable, recommend them for sure"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Perfect edition of the shoe in kids form. I would buy them again.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My kids love them, sold out quickly. My son looks like a g"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My little one loves them ! Super comfy and spacious
Very comfortable and supportive. Great traction and flexibility. Cleats are molded well on these unlike the Alpha Huarache 8 Elite cleats where 2 broke off after only a few months of use. Nike’s returns/customer service was satisfactory which allowed me to put the credit towards these Vapor Edge Elites. True to size.
"Got these for my son for track. He loves them, great fit, comfortable and overall a perfect fit."
"My favorite shoes. Great for running and walking. I find them very comfortable. The all black colorway squeaks on floors, so I would recommend not getting them if you plan to wear them indoors."
All time favorite casual/workout shoe from Nike. I wish they would bring back the all white with the black swoosh colorway. I have bought and worn through like 4 pairs of those over the years.
Extremely comfortable shoe. Fits snug but true to size. First basketball shoe I've bought in a while & I'm not disappointed!  Bought a 2nd pair just to rock since they are so comfortable.
Great shoe for basketball overall. My husband loves it however it came with a small defect.
Really nice trainers

"The Vapor 9.5/X are still the best speed-oriented shoes in the modern game, and I'm glad Nike brought this model back. This shoe has just enough cushioning, is low to the ground, and has great support and lockdown from the lacing system. The lacing system really feels like individual fingers wrapping around your mid-foot, and each one can be customized to the fit you need. I'll keep getting these shoes over the disappointing Vapor 11, which doesn't have good lockdown or court feel. Hopefully Nike carries forward some of the design elements from this shoe into their future Vapor models, not sure why they would ignore such a popular design"
"I love these shoes.  They're a touch heavy relative to other tennis shoes, but they grip well and my feet feel planted when I set them.  I still feel like I can maneuver well around the court and accelerate despite the perceived extra weight.  They also look great, are comfortable, and breathe fairly well.  No complaints.  I ordered a second pair to have as a back-up.  I'm a size 10 in all Nike's, including these.  I don't have any issues with the width of the shoe.  Highly recommend."
"Great overall sneaker. Very comfortable, stable and has a great feel for the court."
"They are a perfect match for my outfit!!
#LSUTIGERS"
"I have the pink running shoes and i absolutely love them! They are so cute, comfortable, and light perfect everyday shoe to workout. I throw mine in the washer with my clothes and air dry them and they will dry so quick! I would definitely purchase again!"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very comfortable and true to size. Feels like a sock.
Fit good probably buy Them another colors
Love the feel. Never really like dunks but these changed my mind.
These shows are so cool. So comfortable
Casual & classic. The suede is cool but looks “off black” because it is suede. Fits true to size. Fits narrow. Have to “break them in”.

Honestly gas if you got bigger feet or something
Thick and supportive slides. Very comfortable.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Hubby had been eyeing these slides for awhile but would never have his size at the store. Until finally after months he was able to find them one random day. He loves how comfortable and cushiony they are.
"Not good, I don't like it.picture and shoes look different to me."
"I use these as my everyday shoes, very comfortable and quality Nikes"
Grandson was delighted with them and they arrived promptly.
"I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and also recently broke my foot. I love the Pegasus. They are extremely comfortable to work out in, and wide enough for my feet. They are the only shoes I buy to work out in after trying multiple different shoes and brands. My son has multiple pairs as well. 
 The only problem I have with these shoes is there is a dark stain on the back of the white part of the shoe, and I am unable to get it out. Very disappointing, but overall comfort and stability is good."
Value for money. Really good shoe.
Ordered these for my daughter and they are amazing!
"First pair of Air Jordans - LOVE THEM!!!

I wear 9 men’s 10.5 Women’s and the shoe fits true to size. Very comfortable and super stylish! I love that the material is not that thick unforgiving material that’s bulky etc. Nice everyday shoe that you can wear with leggings or comfy sweats!"
The top of the shoe has thin leather and it wrinkles up. I don’t like the way that looks.

"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my son's first time with these cleats. So far so good, three weeks in to the season."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great cleats, comfortable and true to size. No painful break in."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are his first pair of baseball shoes with metal spikes. They fit well and feel great.
"Awesome shoes for running.  The bottom of the shoe has so much protection I sometimes run on gravel and there’s broken glass in certain parts but I don’t worry since the shoes keeps feet safe.


Yes the shoe is a snug/tight fit like other reviews but I feel it’s the type of the way this shoe is.  It doesn’t allow the shoes to cause friction when running between the foot and the sole and I average about 5 miles 4times a week and my feet haven’t gained any blisters.  

I love the look though and may get another pair in the future if I run these in the ground fast."
If you’re familiar with the Nike Zoom Victory Waffle 5 these are very similar. They wore in quite quickly with a slightly larger toe box and outsole providing a slight increase in both comfort and performance. I’m looking forward to putting some serious milage on these shoes and i’m confident they are up to the job.
"I wish I read the reviews before purchasing. They fit terribly. I actually think the length of the shoe was fine, but they were extremely tight on the TOP of my feet, as if someone was pushing down on them. I don't think the issue would have been resolved if I'd ordered a size (or even 2 sizes) up, and I didn't want to risk the length being way too big for me to efficiently run in."
"Comfortable! My daughter, 7 years old, wore them to Disney with no problem."
"I bought the Chuck Taylor All Star sneakers for my 6-year-old, and they’ve been fantastic! They are very durable and comfortable, perfect for all the running and playing a kid does. Plus, they look great with just about any outfit. My son loves them and wears them almost every day. Highly recommend for active kids!"
This has been her go to shoes now. Only wants to wear them and the fit is perfect and very comfortable.
I love my uptempos. Very comfortable for my wide feet. I feel I could have went down a half size because they are a little wider then most shoes but other than that I love the fit.
I purchased these as a gift for my daughter. She’s loves them
I love the color of these! I read a review that said they were a huge miss...completely inaccurate! They are exactly as described and received them in like 3 days! These take me back to my teens. This is my 3rd pair from this site and absolutely love it!!!

Very comfortable shoe especially w/out socks. Feel better connected to the ground. Wish I could run cross-country in them. Fast days have been replaced by retirement ones.
I won’t go to the gym unless I have a pair on .This is one of the most comfortable pair of overall training shoes. Good for running and squats . If you could do a black sole would be perfect.
"10/10 it’s in the name FREE run. Those that get it get,"
Snug and comfortable just get a half size down since they run a little bigger
I get them today and they look exactly as the picture. Amazing!
"Got a pair of these a few months ago and they are just overall amazing, I do recommend buying these if your looking for a good pair of cleats."
Runs small but other than that great pair of shoes
Excellent quality great
Brought them for my son's school uniform. The different shades of deep blue look vibrant when worn with navy slacks. Comfy for walking and great for P.E.
I needed a new pair of slides and my husband bought me these in black. I can honestly say these are the best slides I have ever owned! I will definitely be buying these again.
Love them! Very comfortable. I can walk in them all day
These by far are the most comfortable slides I have bought so far.
Walking 9 holes with no problem
"Slight upgrade over last years model. I like the improved lacing system which seems to hug my foot better. I do think last year's Tour 2 had better cushion or ""bounce"" to the insole. This year's model feels much firmer to me which is disappointing. I was hoping they would soften up after a few rounds but that doesn't seem to be the case so far. Probably wouldn't have bought 3 colors knowing what I know now."
Great
love it
Great boots for a everyday use .
So I bought these boots for my daughter for her birthday and she absolutely love them!!
"Incredible speed of deliver , perfect execution process rapidly . Lover love love Nike"
Absolutely stunning and awesome
"Awesome shoe, goes with anything.
Definitely recommend"
Great look for a Nike shoe icon. Comfortable and durable. The premium materials make the shoe look very luxurious.
I love this shoe fits and feels great
"I really liked these shoes, so much that I also bought the same one in green. However, they do run small and this shoe in particular was extremely stiff. It was squeezing my foot even though it was half a size larger than what I use. I ended up returning the red ones, but I kept the green ones. They do look exactly like the image."
I have been looking for a pair of high tops for a while so I thought I would give them a try. LOVE them. I got the white with charcoal and tan colors and they are so cute. My daughter loved them too and now wants a pair. Super versatile and go with lots.
Too small even though ordered correct size poor design
Love the color& that they are suede. They fit perfectly.
Fire shoes buy now worth your money
Very comfortable but I would suggest going a 1/2 size up
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love the shoes. Fit great, stylish. Very happy with purchase."
I can wear these to skate or just casually.  They really are striking.  Comfy.  I love them.
"Love this casual white simply Nike, just what I needed dor my lil short summer dresses!!"
My boyfriend loved these shoes!
"Nice shoe and wears well, wish they had more color options."
The shoe is very comfy and can walk and run for hours.
"The shoes were very comfortable and I’ve really enjoyed them so far. I had to order half a size up and they are definitely really narrow shoes but when broken into, they are very comfortable and I would highly recommend."
I like them bcuz my son doesn’t need my help to put them on and there is no shoelaces.
"Big big flex runner fans in this house! And a split review. All parties love the new look but my youngest prefers the previous gen. He claims his heal slips out and his feet do not feel as secure. With that said, my oldest loves the new fit so it probably depends on the individual and how hard they are playing. True to size and lots of color options still make it one of our favorite no tie shoes."
"My son really likes these. He said they’re super comfy and easy for school since he doesn’t have to tie them. He’s been wearing them often since he’s gotten them. They did get dirty more quickly that I would have anticipated, so I’d probably get him all black in the future."
"I've already purchased this shoe 1 time and am purchasing a second pair a week later. The style caught my eye first off. 
I had seriously injured my leg 2 months ago and my physical therapist suggested I buy Asics, which I did. I've ALWAYS been a Nike fan though but she said the soles weren't stiff enough. ""One"" of the multiple injuries was a badly broken toe which can't be fixed bc its too late. It will take a year to heal, I'm told. In the meantime, every shoe I've worn, causes pain...until these!!! I'm SO happy. They literally support EVERYTHING - from the ankle to the arches (which I don't really need) to the toes. These are the best shoes I've had in ages! They actually got dirty and I threw them in the wash (""quick wash"" cycle) and they came out like brand new. I dried them out in the sun - DONT machine dry them! LOVE these shoes!"
These shoes are so comfortable.  When running they seem weightless and the shoe takes all impact. I love them.
I just don’t understand the QR code on the shoe. Can’t decide if I like it or hate it.
Love these shoes! They are so cute comfortable. They do run a bit small. So be sure to size up a 1/2 size.
Cute and stylish. Love the soft pink color
My daughter where them every day she love her shoes
Ever day use for all occasions.
Cute sneaker at a nice price.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My toddler needed some shoes that were more durable and would also aesthetically be cuter than some of the cheap options. These knock it out of the park! She only wants to wear them lol Bonus: they’re super easy to put on and they stay on too,"
Love these😍😍 one of my fave pairs so far great fit look badboy everyone comments on them
"I love them so comfy,this is my second pair since Christmas,delivery was fab and price was excellent too,definitely be ordering again when need some more."
"Bought the Nike Air Max Plus in Black for my son, he is very happy with them. He says they are very comfortable  and loves the look."
Daughter is enjoying them.  She using them for flag football at school.
"Incredible shoes. They fit snuggly and they look great. 
Extra laces and (unexpectedly) insoles are a great plus!"
"Always stylish, but back in suede, now again sublime.
love the insole/lace options too.
just doin' it."
I absolutely love these shoes but am holding off buying them until they release them in all white again so they lose a star for that. The all white Janoskis have been my go-to for casual wear in the spring/summer but I haven't been able to find them in all white for a few years. Hopefully they bring that color back.
"I have never had a pair of Air Jordan's before and I love them. I bought these in the black/red/white , I also bought the ""Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG Black and White"" ones in men's as well. I wear a size 8.5 in women's and I got both pairs in a size 7 in men's and they fit perfectly! They are so comfortable and such amazing quality. I'm a lesbian but I'm not girly I'm more masculine so air jordans are definitely my style."
Fits great love them worth the price
I didn’t but them from you guys but I love mine. Would recommend
"It is now the ideal size, and I appreciate your careful handling during shipping. I am thankful for your efforts."
The most comfortable Nikes I’ve owned and I have a lot! They are like walking on air and they don’t feel too bulky. Love them
"Beautiful, Comfortable, Stylish..True to size. Love it."
I bought these a month ago to use in the last cross country of the season. The conditions were very muddy and the pyramidal shaped spikes that come with the shoes did not provide enough grip. On firmer ground they were absolutely fine. They were very comfortable to wear and I did buy half a size larger as they do come up small. I shall replace the pyramidal spikes with normal 12mm next time or 15mm if conditions are very muddy. With normal spikes I think they’ll be a good shoe.
Brilliant shoe. Lightweight. Clean up great. Used solely for xc and have been comfortable over both firm and boggy terrain.
"Bought for my son, excellent pair of XC specific spikes. Good support, lightweight and robust"
Very comfortable shoe and it’s a new ce color for the spring
Need more of these pink ones! Need to add pink to the custom design colors so we can design our on.
"These are so cute and very comfortable. They are true to size. My only complaint is the laces, you will need to order some because they don’t stay tied and they are long."
"Excellent, price, quality Hibbett’s a consistent measure."
"These shoes were a great fit for my 4 year old daughter. I love how easy they are for her to put on by herself and strap them, saves time and hassle for me and her school. I would highly recommend these shoes for all toddlers. My daughter says they  are very comfortable and they are now her go to shoes when asked what shoes she would like to wear for the day. The shoes are a great color and stylish!"
"I bought these shoes for my daughter and when they called these the EZ they were not lying. She’s able to put them on and off in a flash and they look so cute on her. Most Velcro shoes aren’t the best looking but these are amazing. They have become her favorite shoe. The materials are durable, she wears them to school and plays in them everyday. I’ll be buying her more."
Don't know yet. They are a birthday gift.  Birthday is in April
My daughter just recently asked me for these and I was amazed at how the trends just carry on year to year I have always loved Chucks and now I may being buying a pair for my daughter when I can. Awesome shoe comfortable and durable last forever

These boots are perfect for the winter! My son loves them so much.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It is a good pair of boots, with a good style, but not waterproof."
These boots are HOT!!!! I bought these winter boots for my 7 year old son and his dad and oldest brother wanted to know if you had them in Adult size because they each want a pair as soon as they seen them! I told them that I wasn't sure but if so I will most definitely buy them some. These boots are so freaking cool! Feels comfortable and my 7 year old said they keep his feet extra warm. He did not want to take them off of his feet!
Didn’t work for my foot. They look good but hurt my foot at the toe box area. It felt like they were squeezing my foot. I tried a Nike elite sock to see if that thick sock would help cushion the sides and it didn’t.
Really really like the shoe itself but they didn’t do well with my right foot.
Dope sneaker..can't go wrong with some bo's
"I missed these. Very good hoop/casual sneakers. Snug fit, but it loosens up over time. Bring back more colors!"
"I purchase this sneakers about two months ago. The fit is extremely snug, but comfortable. I would suggest ordering a half size bigger if you intend to wear socks."
"Very comfortable shoe, bought a pair for basketball and liked it so much bought 2 more pairs for backup and to wear casually since they are so comfortable"
"Had the Pegasus Trail 3, which was an excellent shoe and these are even better. Thanks Nike!"
"Absolutely the best Nike shoe I have ever had. Super comfortable, can wear all day, from hiking, to walking and working. Will definitely keep buying these shoes! Fit is perfect and has amazing grip."
"Great shoes! Got in promotion, making it even better!! Highly recommend! Great experience so far! Works great for running in every kind of environment"
"Amazing, after a few wears. The shoe was a little stiff during first wear or two, but then softens up, and is very comfortable. Able to wear all day, the wedge helps. I’ve gotten a few compliments already. I’m a 8.5 M, but ordered a 9 M, and it fit great. Nike runs on the small side."
Comfortable shoes at a fabulous price
I've found these run much smaller than expected. I've noticed this with most Nike products. I wished they would be true to size because they could be comfy otherwise.
"Great shoe for long runs and super supportive! However, it’s a bit of a boring shoe to look at. Please make them in more exciting colourways."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these for my junior in high school. He loves them and they look great.
"I must have bought easily more that 20 pairs of structures over the years (usually 2-4 pairs annually). This version I am disappointed in. Still same foot support but two big differences from my earlier versions - the tongue is different and I’ve not quite figured out what - it seems flimsier, not as big, not as cushioning. And the shoe laces are terrible - double knotted and they still come undone within about 1 km of walking. I’ve even triple knotted them and they last longer but still eventually come undone. Surely this is something that would easily be found in the lab???"

I love these they fit my look and are comfortable
Its excellent shoe and fast shipping. No problem at all. Will most definitely be purchasing from here again.
The style is perfect
"First let me start off by saying thank you Nike. I order these shoes for my son's birthday which UPS lost them during the delivery process. I called and spoke to a young lady by the name of [Name removed] was so helpful and was able to send out a second pair to replace the missing pair. And she sent them out so quick my son was able to receive them for his birthday. Which he was so over the top happy it made his special day. You gave my baby a, ""Happy Birthday""!!!! Thank you Nike!!!!!"
Get a size up. I was having some Achilles tendon bruising issue with some other cleats but with these having a low heel I’ve had zero issues.
Absolutely love the look of the cleat but definitely a tight fit. I felt it as I put my big size 14 in them!!
"We bought these baseball shoes for our 10 year old grandson that plays the game at an exceptional level and thought he needed shoes to match his skills.  The foundation of the shoes are TPU.  They are as close to metal cleats as you can get.  Although these shoes are expensive, in researching other brands that have a tendency to wear down quickly, we were looking for something that could continue to provide the traction he needs playing nearly 75 games per year and year round weekly practices."

"Love these old school Jordans, had a similar pair the first time round. Look smart and really comfortable"
"The garments provide a high level of comfort, and the color is aesthetically pleasing."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This was the best purchase I have made and I am so happy
"These are the most uncomfortable pair of Nikes I have ever worn. I’ve bought hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars worth of Nike shoes and never hated a pair as much as this one. The shape of the toe looks mad weird in person, the heel slides of unless the shoes are tied so tight your blood flow is cut off and they’re slightly lower rise then expected. Definitely don’t recommend buying these, I regret wasting my money."
I am obsessed with this shoe! You can dress it up or down! Comfy and stylish!
"I like then, give my 5 foot self a boost."
My 3 year old loves these
Excelente
Love these and very comfortable…
Most comfy Slides out there. With no half size I went to the next size up and they fit perfect.
Im a guy who would never wear slides because they were either uncomfortable or would fall off my feel while walking. Im a huge NFL fan so I ordered my favorite team to wear while on vacation. These slides were very comfortable. The fit was perfect. No slipping off the foot. I even found myself picking these over my sneakers. The comfort of these slides alone is worth the purchase.
"Comfortable slips, and my favorite team.  They look awesome also."
Comfortable and durable
I love the shoes. There comfortable seem like there gonna last longer then the shoes I've had lately. I enjoy them
"I bought these a few weeks ago. They look great. I get many compliments. But they squeak when I walk!!! At first I thought it was my socks but no, the tongues rub angainst the upper and they squeak loud when I walk. So I’m bummed out. I also have the all black nubuck/suede pair and those are perfect. No issues. So yeah, I’m disappointed. Does anyone else have this problem? Or is it just a bad pair? I wish I knew."
Perfect fit and extremely comfortable
"These are great! Ordered half a size up as recommended by other reviews, and they're a perfect fit."
Some of the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned.
"So comfy! I coach varsity soccer and was looking for the perfect game shoe for on the sidelines, I want to look professional and be able to step up and get a touch on the ball whenever needed through warm ups. We have a Nike contract from shoulders to ankle and these look as good as they feel - i love that the toe box didn’t feel crammed or super narrow"
Very good and comfortable indoor shoe
"Great style. Don't see many of these around. Only wish the toe box was a bit higher. I have a large ""big toe"" and it rubs a bit on the underside of the shoe's toe box. Overall, a great shoe."
"Shoes are very comfortable, look cool also"
My feet run wide. These fit perfectly. Just the right amount of flash for a usually conservative dresser.
Love these. They’re comfortable and you can dress them up or down. True to size.
Comfy!! Goes with everything! So many compliments everytime I wear them.
Not only are these adorable they are also comfortable! I will have these in all the colors!
"They are comparable, but I got a hole in the material towards the front of the shoe."
I bought these shoes for my son but I noticed the youth sizes are really big so I tried getting this color for myself and they are absolutely divine. I love sneakers and this color combination it’s very pretty. These shoes are very comfortable. I would say they’re on the wide side a little bit. I have wide feet and they feel so comfy not tight at all. I love them
"I bought these nike for my 9 year old to wear in school. He absolutely loves them. These shoes have plenty of space to make the foot feel comfortable, not tight at all. They’re light, comfy when walking. He can wear them all day and not get tired. I had to get him another pair in black."
"Bought then a few weeks ago, loved them for my daughter however the back is not like green but purple the shoes don’t have green on them anywhere and are a slightly more muted purple then in the picture. I will also say they do fit more on the larger side… i should have sized down but she’ll grow into them."
So cute!!!
These sneakers are great for family matching and go with anything. My daughter says that the kids' version is comfortable and she wants to wear them frequently.
"I just got my Nike Cortez in white and cosmic green.  WOW…so excited because the last time I wore these retry shoes was in college.  Just love them!!  But I would recommend ordering them in a size up if you wear them with socks, otherwise order your regular size.  Thanks Nike for bringing the retro shoes back!"
"I like my old/new school Cortez shoes.
Want them without the blue in my size.
I’m a 60 year old that still loves me some Cortez shoes…"
My husband loves these sneakers that I had to buy another pair & send them to our vacation spot. I even had to buy two in each color due to this & that he really loves these sneakers. I even got a pair for myself & they are so comfortable.
"The Nike V2K Run is a testament to Nike’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of performance and style. As an enthusiastic runner, I was eager to put these shoes to the test, and they did not disappoint.

One of the standout features of the V2K Run is its innovative design, which seamlessly combines support and flexibility. The dual-density foam midsole provides excellent cushioning and stability, allowing for a smooth and comfortable ride mile after mile. Whether I’m pounding the pavement or hitting the trails, these shoes offer the perfect balance of protection and responsiveness.

But what truly sets the V2K Run apart is its attention to detail.

socks will fall down but they are cute
"I have not worn these yet, waiting for the right occasion. Just the right hint of shimmer to make them a feature."
I bought these to replace my original white pair as they were getting a little tired. Anyone who wears air force trainers will know how comfortable they are. Great for and look stylish.
"My second pair of these!....I find them very liberating to run in, very flexible and bendy sole and soft stretchy ultra-comfortable upper. Unstructured just how I like it. I go down half a size in these as I run in them without socks, this gives me a great connected and responsive feel from my runs. Like I say quite liberating running in these, especially when sockless. Worth a try, you might like it YOLO :)"
Wow - For the absolute longest time I have been waiting for Nike to unleash the free fly knits to a more versatile performance shoe and it has arrived!  Granted for running my all-time favorite Nike shoe for running is the Nike ZoomX Invincible Run Flyknits because of the bounce and cushion support on impact but this has that support on impact and feels so comfortable compared to other running shoes.  What is amazing about this shoe is it can transition from working out indoors in a gym and running on a treadmill to taking it outdoors and running on the road.  All with the comfort and breathability of free fly knits and have been waiting for this shoe for a while.
"I’m a big guy and have wide feet. 6’7” 340 lbs and I work out 6 days a week. It’s really hard for me to find workout shoes that fit well. These are extremely light, offer great support, look great, they check all the boxes. I ordered 2 more pair after I got these so I have them for the future."

"I love these shoes! Fit is perfect, comfort is great and traction is even better. The only issue I had is the air sole popped within the first couple rounds and now it makes an annoying air leak sound everytime I walk. That’s the only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars. Pretty bummed about that, but love them otherwise."
Literally the only golf show that Nike makes thy fit my feet. I wear standard width in all other shoes but Nike golf shoes are all WAY more narrow. This shoe in wide fits like a standard width and the boa system is so convenient. Make more wide options with more boa options please.
"Awesome price, but too small for the child they were bought for"
"My baby girl loves these shoes. They are so easy to take on and off but not for her… which is a bonus. They have a side Velcro
Opening which makes it easy to put on my baby girl. These are one of the first pairs of shoes that she does not take them off and they do not fall off. Super quality."

great product
"Velcro has been fine. I use them twice a week for legs day only. They strap tight enough to make your feet numb. The insoles are rock hard too. They are so solid and inflexible that they are impractical for anything other than leg exercises. They clip when you walk. They are absolutely not comfortable, but they aren’t supposed to be. They change the way lifts feel bc they alter the lines of the lift. I won’t type out the physics of that, but it is noticeable and puts more focus on anterior chain muscles. The colors (white/pink/orange) are bright and fun."
"The fit is tight but feels great when lifting. I wear a size 8 and got a size 8. When wearing the shoe I need to wear thin shocks, the everyday Nike socks."
Wanted these shoes since last year but couldn’t get my hands on them and then when I did I was very excited because the colorway is sooooo nice!!!!
I love these shoes it’s just hard to find a fit that goes with them😭
Great color but the quality just isn’t there.

I purchased this shoe after having many problems finding the perfect shoe for me that is both comfortable and yet snappy enough to keep my light on my feet. I have just recently began getting into longer distance running after years of being an athlete and I am not disappointed with this purchase. They will feel a little wobbly at slower paces but other than that no complaints.
"Lightweight is the best part
Would go half a size down though"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Took them out for a 20 mile long run straight out of the box and felt great. Having had many happy miles in original alphaflys I've been waiting patiently for the V2 to be discounted so I could pick them up in time for Manchester Marathon.

The best aspect so far is the beaming color. The fit however is a bit bulky and awkward. I am a women size 8.5 but had to size up to size 10 as my normal size is too small.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these cause I don't have any gray shoes and I saw these J's and I fell in love!!
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] True to fit. Great buy for my son. Loves the color pattern
Very happy was a gift for my godson he loved them
"I returned these shoes because quite frankly they were fugly. The color was washed out. The fit was tight so I recommend ordering at least a half size up, if you like this look."
Absolutely love them. So comfy. Black and white has been perfect for pairing with smart and casual. Don’t wash them though. I faded the black. Oops
"I really like the shoes. They were a gift so I couldn’t return but the toe parts were different on the shoes and I don’t think it’s supposed to be that way. Overall, comfy though and I was thinking about getting my own."
"Shoe was even better quality than expected. 
Extremely satisfied & would definitely recommend!"
I received this item ahead of promised delivery date.  This shoe is very comfortable and it looks good.
Amazing shoes amazing service.
"I love the shoe, but I only gave it 4 stars because of the fit. It is very narrow. Definitely not make for people with any type of width to their foot."
Fast shipping and great price 😁
"Great shoes, good look. definitely worth buying"
"I had the Metcon 4 and they lasted 5 years and saw these and thought it’s time. OMG they are so amazing I do cross fit style workouts and I felt so solid and such a great base foundation under me. Such an incredible difference. More stiff than the 4’s and I was worried they might cause chaffing on my ankle, but they didn’t. Day 1 and I’m a Metcon for life gal!"
I love these shoes! They’re super comfortable and really unique looking. They will look cute this summer with shorts or even a sun dress.
Very comfortable. Wide toe box. True to size. Great colour & great price. Perfect shoes for weight lifting.
I bought them for my son in black and they are his favorites. He says they are comfortable. I like the classic design.
"Prompt as ever, they are a lovely shoe my wee little man loves them great sizing"
Bought the black and white pair for my son. 2nd time purchasing. He had a pair when previously when he was smaller. Easy to slip on and off.
I got these on a different phone btw but I love these these are so cool and fuzzy I will try not to get them dirty they are really cool
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I absolutely love these! So comfortable! I wear these almost everday!
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are so cute in person! I did have to size down a half size

"Bought these, reviews seemed decent, first few runs no issues then they started to split"
Excellent quality and value  Comfortable and stylish
"Bought this last year, did not last long and not that great as it squeaks."
Love Pegasus 83… Comfortable sneakers
"When I first put on these shoes, they felt slightly stiff, but with normal wear, I hoped they’d get to the level of extreme comfort advertised. While these shoes did lose some of their “new shoe stiffness”, something about them cushioning kept these from becoming the ultimate walking around shoes I was hoping for. These absolutely deliver a comfort only Nike shoes have given me, but if presented the opportunity to choose between these shoes and a pair of air max shoes, I lean towards choosing an air max."
I like the fit and the comfort.
Gorgeous little runner. Fits perfectly and nice and wide. The tongue folds down on both sides so very easy to get on. Love them
Look and fit well received in short amount of time
Super cute!!

Back in the day ACG meant that your show was water resistant if not waterproof. I had this impression when I purchased this pair to find out that it so perforated that even rain would get your feet wet. So ACG means nothing in this shoe and if you expect any water resistance or repellency look elsewhere or buy a pair of sandals.
"Frustrating Sticker Woes with Nike Shoes

I've been a loyal Nike customer for years, purchasing a variety of shoes ranging from running to fashion and hiking. However, one persistent issue has turned my positive experiences into frustrating ones - the nightmare of removing those super sticky stickers from the insoles.

Removing the paper sticker from the fabric top insole is anything but enjoyable. The stickiness is on another level, and more often than not, remnants of the sticker remain stubbornly attached to the fabric. The recent experience was the worst yet, leaving me in a situation where my socks would frequently adhere to the sticky goo left behind.

I'm all for a brand that evolves and improves, and Nike, it's high time you address this sticky situation. The insole sticker ordeal significantly dampens the overall joy of owning and wearing your shoes. Nike you believe you can do better !"
Great shoes. The only thing they run small for me. I have to get half size bigger
Excellent improvements from the original blazers
"Awesome, got perf"
Luv the. Shoe
"These are so comfortable, and I get so many compliments, I even had people take photos of them!"
"Team Red is more of a dark, purplish-red. Just a heads up that it’s not a typical red."
Vomero continues to be a phenomenal model. Complete absence of feeling any pounding during ground impact. No tightness felt anywhere. Such a great pair of shoes that I do not even think about them while I am running. Much much thanks to Nike for making the Vomero available again to mid-to-long distance runners such as myself who had to rely on other shoe competitors for a size 4E wide foot. Extremely grateful.
I agree with other online reviews in which this shoe is described as a premium Pegasus. The soft responsiveness of the foam gives an enjoyable experience. There are some that complain about weight but it’s not noticeable with these shoes and besides most people despite what they believe won’t know the difference between a half ounce.
"The Vomero 17 seems like a really nice, well made shoe.  However, if like me, you are buying the extra wide version because of the need for a wider toe box, the Structure 25 is a better option.  Given both shoes are available in black, I have to go with the Structures.  If the blue Vomeros come out in wide I will give them another look, but overall, they are a little bit of a disappointment for those with a wide toe box, especially compared to the Vomero 16s."
"I’ve never had AF1s before, but these have become a staple! They’re much more comfortable than my other fancy leather sneakers, and the thick sole has helped them stay clean. They’re a bit heavy, but I appreciate the bouncy sole when I’m on my feet all day. The pearl pink color is also perfect—it’s not too bright, and goes with everything."
"I purchased these November 29 and I wear them all the time I believe I wore a flare pants that might’ve gotten dye on this unknown material but it seems it like this material is a magnet for dirt, its noticeable, and think i made it worse trying to clean."
"Wanted a pair of trainers to go with denim shorts for summer, these are a chunky style as expected - felt really comfy straight away."
Looks EXACTLY like the picture! And the fit is normal for blazers which is a bit snug. Overall amazing Christmas gift :)
"Excellent fit, quality, and style"
I picked these up so I didn’t have to wear my regular shoes when doing chores. These are great and don’t make my feet all sweaty like Bogs. i look stylish while out on the farm! At first these seemed tight but they formed to my feet quickly and are easy and comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Easy clean up and no water in shoes when walking through low puddles. Highly recommend!
"The shipping was fast, ordering online was quick and easy and the price I paid for them was unbelievable. Will be ordering online again in the near future."
These boots are stylish and practical for winter. The color combination is 🤌

"Top marks for comfort and style.  They seem to run a little big.  May want to consider order a half-size smaller.  They are none too wide, though.  If you have a EE- foot, they are tight.  Not tight enough to uncomfortable, but a little tighter than you want. I have only worn them for 3 rounds, so I am hoping for a little stretch.

I have real doubts about how they will perform in dewy/wet grass.  If you play in the wet, these may not be for you."
Very similar to air Jordan sneakers but about 1 size bigger so order down a size from your air Jordan sneaker size.
Love these shoes!! So comfortable and they look great for The Masters!!
too small. i got size 9 and it was the exact same size as my size 8
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My daughter is happy with these spikes. Its usually tough to find soccer cleats in the spring
Item just as described. Size guide assured the perfect fit. Beautiful! Shipped very fast.

Really nice shoe very comfortable the do run a little tight so I recommend getting a half size bigger if anything like all my other air max shoes I get complements all over too I ordered another 2 pairs might order another pair
It’s a nice looking shoe but it’s pretty tight and heavy.
"These shoes are really comfortable! I always like a shoe(Let alone a style of apparel) that have a bone/tan/apricot color way. For me this is probably a top 3 color way for the air max pulses. I’m usually a size 12 but imo, they run a lil small. So for my recommendation get a size bigger. The sizing is really smooth as well as the color way of the shoe cause it represents spring time let alone fall time lol. So I would advise you to get you a pair before they sold out."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love these Jordans I been trying to buy them in every color they have them in. They are very pretty. There comfortable and they look good with any pants I wear with them.
"I am so in love with these trainers! I saw them, instantly had to have them. They are beautiful. Perfect baby oink colour, complimented with white and grey tones. BUY THEM! Don’t wait!"
Idk if my shoes were exposed to something that made the color look the way they do but this shoe is hideoeus ( in color). In the photos it looked like a clean tan and brown shoe in person the brown is almost yellow and some of the tan parts are like a camo greenish brown color. I’ve tired for months to match these ugly shoes and alas I have found nothing cause the color is so off putting and weird.
First time I bought these shoes I did not have to go through the hassle of removing almost 50% of the shoelace just to get my foot inside now they want to give you an excessive amomount of shoelaces and make your shoe very tight its annoying
They are perfectly good shoes to match anything and any
I thought they were the all leather but the velcro was different and i felt it extra high top had to return was not for me
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Run true to size. Comfortable and seem to be durable.
"Very nice shoes for my kid. Kid loves them. ""Very light and comfortable."" He said"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My son loves these and they look super cool! Quality seems good so far
"This is the first time I bought Nick's shoes! And I bought it online! Because there is no physical try-on, I'm worried that it doesn't fit my feet! What I didn't expect was that the size was very standard! The physical object matches the picture! It's very comfortable and light to wear! Suitable for all kinds of outdoor activities. I will continue to buy this type of shoes in the future! Save time! Express delivery is fast.
Highly recommende"
"Wow. These are awesome. I ran my last half marathon in the Pegasus trail, and I was less than impressed. I went to the Wildhorse but felt those needed more cushioning. When I started doing road races in the vaporfly, I was really hoping that Nike would do some sort of vaporfly hybrid shoe for trails and I feel like this is it! I took it right out of the box on a 7 mile adventure, with about 2k feet of vert in the first 2 miles and then a downhill 3 mile run on a fire road, before hitting 2 miles on pavement.They performed superb. They are ultralite (6.5oz in my size) and have a super wide toebox, which is unlike most Nike products. This means that you’re not gonna get any pressure on your toenails and they’re not hitting up against the front of the shoe. They’re super breathable and the carbon fiber plate definitely gives you a little propel forward. I’m so excited that Nike finally got a contract with Vibram because the soles are incredibly grippy. I don’t know how this shoe would do on super technical terrain, considering it is a race shoe, so it’s meant to be fast and agile. But I don’t know if it would protect you from kicking a rock or hitting a rock with anything near your ankle. You’re definitely gonna feel that. I’m all in for taking this on my next race and super excited to see how I perform in this shoe. I love that there’s no break in time with Nike ever and I’m really happy to see that they have stepped it up with their trail running shoes. We needed this!"
Excellent birthday present for my girlfriend . She has Vapour fly for road and she loves these for trail
I’ve only worn these for two practices and they’ve broken in really easily and broken into my foot. They are comfy for being cleats and keep you flashing out there on the field.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Team looks great with their matching cleats on the new turf. #rolltroj
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Cleats fit true to size. My son says they feel great on his feet.
"Great, the little guy loves them and he can’t kick them off. Perfect"
Love these shoes I’m on my feet 14 hours a day and absolutely come home without my feet being sore
Great wear comfortable fit will recommend to anyone looking for a comfortable shoe
I bought these for the comfort factor while traveling. The shoes are very breathable keeping my feet cool while walking around in the heat. they are stylish to wear waking around.
"I love these shoes. The knitting is very well done. I don't use these shoes for running, but I do use them for weight lighting, and they are very stable."
is a beautiful shoes. My son is happy .
Nice style shoes for my nephew.
Just as described very lightweight my son loves them
Love them !!💗I feel very happy with my purchase.
Really happy with these shoes…as always with Nike. Be aware it comes with a “wrap” and it’s a little difficult to get positioned just right.
Love the shoe!! And comfortable!!
Most comfortable pair of shoes i’ve ever worn. I’m flat footed and  these are best shoes I’ve ever had for that issue honestly can’t even tell when my foot touches the ground it’s like walking on a cloud.
"I’m flat footed, I was hesitant about buying these. Glad I did, very comfortable shoes. Will buy other pairs."
My favorite ones so far and I’m looking forward to the next release coming soon
Absolutely love them! Looked at them for weeks before finally deciding that I needed them in my life!
Love the colors. Always a comfortable shoe to walk and workout in
The colors looked different in person. What looked like more of a gold online looked like almost a gray/green. Not cute.
"I bought the one in Coconut Milk/Summit White/Smokey Mauve and it felt like walking on bricks when I tried them on. I guess this is because it's made out of ""sustainable materials"" so it's not comfortable but like come on now. The colorway was perfect but I had to return it cuz I was so disappointed, can't say the same for other pairs of Nike shoes but avoid this one at all costs."
"The quality of these has gotten so much worse over time. I bought a pair, literally three hours ago and all i’ve done is drive and some how they’re already creased. I’m an avid Nike wearer but every pair of Dunk lows i’ve bought in the last six months have had this problem."
I love the colors and they are so comfy! These are my favorite dunks!
The quality is good and the style is wonderful.
These shoes were great for my daughter who recently started walking. Very comfortable fit as she doesnt try to rip them off like others lol
"Thrilled with the AIR JORDAN 11 CMFT LOW shoes! Gifted these to my godson on his 2nd birthday, and the joy on his face was priceless. The infant/toddler lifestyle shoes are not only stylish but also incredibly comfortable. The quality and design exceed expectations, making them a perfect choice for little feet. A stellar purchase that adds a touch of coolness to his growing wardrobe!"
"So cute, comfy, and wide foot friendly! I’m a true 9.5, and i sized down to a 9 fits which fits perfectly."
They are beautiful I love them they arrived on time correct size good condition I'm satisfied I will purchase again
This is my first pair of Air Force Ones but I was pleasantly surprised. They are so cute and the colors are so vibrant. They are much sturdier than some of my other Nike Shoes. Great Quality.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love the look and comfort. AF1 will never go out of style.
Definitely platform!!! Very comfortable and may I add very fast shipping!!! Thanks Nike...
These shoes are super freaking cute and I wish so bad that they would have fit me but they are really tight they're almost like a plastic so not very stretchy.
Runs a little big. Comfortable with thicker socks. Patent exterior makes for easy cleaning.
Shoe exterior appearance is a lot nicer in person. The pics don’t do justice how attractive this shoe’s appearance is. Price was affordable and quality is what you’d expect from a top tier brand like Nike. Highly recommend.
I'm a size 10W/8.5M. I ordered a half size up (9M) based on the reviews and it was to small. I returned it for a 10M and its a perfect fit. Would buy me another color.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Nice shoe with high quality construction. Time will tell about durability of velcro straps even though they are large straps....

I went on a trip and they rip apart
All white are 🔥 I love them! My kids love them!
"Shoe looks great, but  too small, had to purchase a half size larger and still too small. Recommend ordering one full size larger but I can't now as its out of stock.
Very disappointed"
This shoe fit perfects and the colors are so beautiful in person. the pictures do it no justice
"Like the style of these, as well as the vibrant colors. Our baby hasn't worn them yet. She's still to young/small for them. But can't wait for when she does get to wear them."
I'm happy with the trainers
My son loves these shoes! He said they are so comfy and he plays them for basketball and indoor soccer at his school. They are very light and flexible. Only issue he does have is putting them on. The tongue area is not that stretchy for his foot to fit in smoothly so it does take a bit of time. I think for that age range size they should definitely be more stretchy.
"We got these shoes for our four year old. The look and feel is very ""athletic"" - they don't look like ""kids"" shoes which, to my son, seemed to be a great thing.

As soon as he saw the sneakers, he wanted to wear them. He couldn't get them on himself - he usually is not challenged by this sort of thing but for this pair, he had to get help from us. There is a huge loop on each sneaker, which an adult finger can fit through (really thoughtful and appreciated!!) but even with that aid, we had quite a bit of trouble getting the sneakers on.

Once they are on, though, they're super stylish and our son reports they're very comfortable. We have the gray and white and it looks great. We are happy with the way they fit and look and he is happy with the way they feel. The only real drawback is how difficult they are to put on."
"As a sneakerhead I have tried to buy my 4 year old every type of Nike and Jordan shoe under the sun but they always have something that doesn't work, they hurt his feet, they are hard for him to get on, they are hard for me to get on him and so when I  got the Flex Runner 3 PS I was skeptical but boy was I wrong this is a great shoe that he can put on himself and allows him to be as active as he wants. They are stretchy so they are easy to put on, light but not too light and a great amount of cushioning that is very responsive or to quote him ""I think they might even be too bouncy"" they were not in fact too bouncy. I highly recommend this shoe especially for kids with wider feet or difficulty putting on their shoes, these are now his go to pair and I get to see a Check on the side of his foot instead of Daniel Tiger."
"Well-constructed shoe, with a nice wide fit. Solid tread that is meant for trails but has worked well on blacktop pavement. This shoe will not disappoint."
"The best trail shoe- amazing comfort and grip, great breathability"
I like the Wildhorse line the purchase was my second . For my size(big &Tall) the sturdy base and the stylish patterns are a plus for me.
Love these shoes!! But make sure u order at least a size and half up or 2 sizes up!! I had to for both my girls but overall awesome volleyball shoes!! Normally wears 8.5 I got her 9s way to small… I returned those and ordered 11s they were perfect
I got them half a size up from my usual size and they are very tight. I’ve been breaking them in for about a day now and they have loosened up a tiny bit. I love the grip on the bottom! Very comfortable and has good support although it doesn’t cover the ankle.
These shoes are so legit. Order them for myself in size 11 in men’s. They say women volley ball shoes but they are great for men also. Great ankle support for bball and grip. I got both white and the black pair.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great fit for everyday baseball. From practice to games.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought for my son. Still breaking them in, but so far, so good!"
I bought some used but they were great! lots of traction works for every position. i am a Qb but i run as well. Very good and durrable recomend to everyone
"The shoes are great. I would recommend your company to other people, especially getting the shoes ahead of schedule."
so good tbh best shoe
Very comfy!! Love the colors! And very stylish!!
I wanted to love these but they are cut way too small. I bought hubby a size 9 thinking we'll go up a size and these slides need to be bought 3 sizes up. They are kid sizes and cut very narrow. I had to purchase another pair before returning because we need the shoe for a trip. Ugh so sad about this one.
Bought these for my son. He thought they were really cool. I was so happy he actually approved of my choice!
"Very comfortable and i love the looks of these. However, They run small!! I purchased a pair for my husband in a size 10 and they just fit and he is a size 9 and a half. so i suggest that you go 2 sizes up."
"Great lifter, comfortable and supportive. I read the reviews prior to purchasing and went up half a size. Great fit but definitely narrow in the toe."
I'm a size 8 but got the 8.5. Fits great. Very high quality 👌 definitely will order a second one possibly in white but the black looks amazing
"I love the crafteness and the quality of the material, well fitted."
Amazing shoe. Arrived quickly and on time. Website was easy to use to order. Free shipping was a plus.
"I used to wear these when they were just regular sneakers, but to be able to sport them as a golf shoe while playing my favorite sport is simply perfect!"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] They are amazing and so comfortable.definitely recommend these!
"Excellent quality as always but you cant tighten the laces so my foot moves in the shoe. Ive never returned shoes before but may have to with these unfortunately. Ive worn the same size shoe for 30 years. This is the first time a nike shoe ""didn't fit"".  Ill order a different jordan after the return."
"I play to win, whether during practice or a real game. And I will not let anything get in the way of me and my competitive enthusiasm to win"
Great fitting sneakers. I have been waiting for Jordan to create a shoe that makes it easy for me to wear. Due to a disability I wear braces on my feet so I am always looking for an easy to wear shoe.  This is it! Thanks NIke
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Nice cleat, very stylish and comfortable. Made to perfection. Has the appropriate support in the ankels and around Achilles. Unisex."
I got a size 5.5 men because that my normal wear when I got it they fit small so I had to return them and got a whole size up 6.5 men and they fit perfect I like the way they feel and have grip to the ball
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought these cleats a month ago. Comfortable. Game winners!
Good shoe my friends like the shoe so I told them where I bought it and they went to buy some good colors.
It’s so Cute love the color any every thing
"Very tight comfortable fit, wore to my game and I had no issues... Great Buy, highly recommend!!! 👌"
I was looking at shoes not to buy any but then I came across these Nikes I remember when they came out and when I seen the price I couldn't believe it I had to get them when they came I put them right on absolutely love the fit I have a fat foot and they feel good.
THE STYLE IS DIFFERENT BUT ALSO OK NOTHING SPECIAL FITS PRETTY GOOD BUT THATS BASICALLY IT NOT REALLY A FAN
I normally wear a size 8 but based on the comments I ordered an 8.5. They were still wayyyyy too small and narrow! They were super cute and wish I could've fit into them but it just didn't work out. I would've ordered a bigger size but after seeing how narrow they were on my feet I figured this wasn't the shoe for me! sad :((((((
Super light love them so much I bought two pairs
"Very lightweight, stylish and comfortable! I normally wear 9.5 but after reading the reviews I purchased size 10 and they're a perfect fit!"
The shoes are good for basketball. It also has good comfort.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My 10 year old wanted to go with a retro pair of AJs but fortunately I was able to talk him into trying the latest-and-greatest AJ tech. He loves them...first pair of hoop shoes he refuses to wear outside for fear of messing them up.
Bought these for my son and reminded of the Jordan's they had back in the in my days but with an enhanced design. Definitely recommend these.
New favorite shoes look so great
These are great but you need to size down.
"Runs big, cute style"

Loved these as a kid and had to have them again!

Great for running streets with comfort and support without too much weight to the shoes
I am a huge fan of the Pegasus running shoes. I'm also a proud American. It was an immediate buy combining Pegasus and USA pride. These shoes are super comfortable and look great. Highly recommended.
"Love how they look, but definitely recommend sizing up. I’m usually a size 8 but these fit tight and half a size up would probably fit better and more comfortable."
"I love my shoes, very comfortable and stylish looking."
"Love the style, the fit, they have their own creator"
"Real good shoes like always, I've been buying nike shoes and I've always been very satisfied with my and my children shoes, real good customer service and everybody in the canutillo n,m outlet mall store"
"Poor quality, my daughter only wears them two to three times a week for either practice or game time.  She’s only been playing in them since December and they have already torn at the toe.  This shoe does not hold up to Nike quality."
Clean shoes. Excellent addition with the lion logo on back of heel. Great materials. Would buy again.
"Loving my new NIKE AIR ZOOM G.T. CUT 2.0's baby baby!!!!
The fit is right on point with these and they are extremely comfortable. The shoes design is really nice as well as the fabric.
I'm loving the color, which is perfect for breast cancer awareness month.
The grips on these are out of this world.
They must be from another planet because I'm about to go Space Jam on my opponents.
I wouldn't change a thing about my knew kicks.
They've got everything I need to get out on the court and make big moves."
One of my favorite shoes I've purchased all year. Minimal break in time. There's a minor heel slippage but I don't think of it much. The hyper pink gets all the looks at the court. Ordered women's size 11.5 for my men's 10.
My daughter loves them. She did size up 1/2 size for a more comfortable fit with basketball socks.
"I bought them for my boyfriend, he loved them!! 
he is a size 10 on shoes, but on slides 11... they run a little tight so go a size up and your good to go"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The top of the shoe is extremely narrow and tight so he could not even slide his foot into the shoe.
Very cute but falling apart. We bought them less than 2 months ago and they already have a hole in toe. Stitching is coming undone.
Just have to know get a size up when you buy there wonderful shoes 100
"Beautiful shoes , thanks 🙏🏼"
"I was a little skeptical of the look of these on the website but I figured the functionality outweighed fashion so I bought them. So glad I did. They are a shoe wrapped in waterproof lining and so they’re the comfort you’d expect from Nike with the added bonus of complete waterproofness. Now, I’m not saying you can go diving for golf balls in the water hazard and come out with dry feet. But in rain or stepping through a puddle these kept my feet dry. I felt indestructible on the course. 

All that said, with my black rain pants they look pretty unassuming. Very happy with the purchase."
I bought these for my wife. She didn’t think she’d like them and even didn’t want me to buy them lol. Of course I know classic quality when it comes to these things and now she’s getting an eye for noticing these things as well. She absolutely loves them!
Wife loves them. Easy to style.
"They were comfortable, affordable , and cute and goes well with almost anything"
These boots and Nike itself are amazing! I ended up needing to exchange a size up and they made the process SO quick and easy and I was able to get the larger size within the same week - in time for the weekend! I wore them straight out of the box to a rave and danced for 6 hours and walked around town a bit afterward. No blisters! I can only imagine how much more comfortable they will become once they've been properly broken in. Absolutely incredible service from Nike and some absolutely incredible (and stylish!) boots.
"These shoes are amazing! Bought them while I was sightseeing in NYC and left the store wearing them because I didnt want to carry such a large box. Spent the whole day walking around the city and my feet didnt hurt AT ALL. They are incredibly comfortable and look sooo good, I just love them!"
"Okay, so these are better than I would have expected. They were intimidating just from not seeing in them in person or being able to try them on. When I actually tried them on, they did look cuter on my feet than when in the box. I'm so happy I checked reviews and went ahead and purchased. I am very satisfied. I like to purchase unique shoes and clothing and these babies are well into that category! So glad I bought the green ones before they sold out in my size. I've already purchased a different color within less than a week. I would probably have turned these away because of the thick bottom, but it actually makes them cooler when you get to try them on. Like others said, don't think about it too much. These boots are awesome, comfortable, and stylish. I went with my regular size 7 as I choose in all women sneakers/boots."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] bought for my grandson
he really likes them and says they are very comfortable"
I bought this and in 3 days it arrived when it arrived it came well packaged and the shoes feel great there nice comfortable and good looking
"This product itself is great - comfortable to wear, fits well and very light weight. However I have a big complaint about the sizing. I have been wearing size 10 all my life but when it comes to Tiempo Legend 10 it is no longer consistent. I bought a pair of Legend 10 Pro TF it needed to be adjusted to 10.5. I bought this Legend 10 Academy MG it needed to be adjusted to 11. For me, I had to repeat purchase/return cycle multiple times. For Nike, they got higher return rate which is not good for the business. Really hope Nike can take action to make sizing consistent."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these for my grandson for his first year in track and they fit perfect. He loves them and says they are comfy and look great. He came in first in two events and second in his other event! Nice shoes.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bpught for my son, he says they are very light weight and fit perfectly"
Great light weight shoe for long distance. I would recommend for a compromise between Nike revival and Nike zoomx dragonfly
"Love these cleats, style, comfort, they have it all. Traction is great on turf or natural grass.Even better then last years"

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought these for my lineman son and they fit great.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Comfortable to wear and ankle feels secure 
Would recommend"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these cleats a month ago for my son who now wears a size seven in men’s. The kid loves them they are light and have a nice sleek look to them.
"My kids love these shoes, but every single pair has broken in 1-2 weeks and the front of the shoe separates from the sole."
"Love them, they are comfortable even when I am on my feet 15hrs."
"Wow! My son absolutely loved these, he has many different styles of Nike shoes and this is by far his favorite. He put them on and immediately started saying they were super comfortable, fast forward 10 hours later and he’s still wearing them even in his room playing videos games.  He said his feet were so comfortable he didn’t want to take them off. I’d say they run tts but we did go half size up and I believe that helped with the comfort."
I love it. Super comfy. Looks like on picture 🥰🥰🥰🥰
"These trainers are the comfiest I’ve had, they are slightly bigger on the sizing but overall they are great for gym and running."
"It looks beautiful,  but it is VERY slippery on wet floor/ground, I slipped twice and almost fell.... it is marketed as trail shoes but it is not. It is OK in the gym but too risky to run outside"
"Wanted to skate in this shoe but I love these too much as my go to work shoe with a nice outfot or just something I cam slide into quickly when I go out. They are light and I comfortably walk around them all day. Gonna have to settle for a new skate shoe these are too fresh to destroy. 

I hope Nike doesn't release more colorways because then I'm going have a spending problem."
Love Janoski. Idk why Nike stoped making them because they are by far the best SB shoe out there. Would love more colors!
So glad they brought these back!! Can't wait for additional color combos.
"These are everything I have come to expect from Nike on the Air Force 1. Quality leather, stitching and cushioning and sock liner are very comfortable, as is the AIR cushioned sole. The university red swoosh is outlined in a silver stitching helping the color pop."
"Very nice, quite comfortable and good quality, I hope they make launches of this style of Air Force 1, in other colors."
They look even better with my Mahomes jersey then I imagined
"Also, my first pair of AF 1's and I'm extremely happy with these. Solid and comfortable and look amazing with any outfit. Also got them in 2 days, pretty impressive."
First pair of Air Force Ones and couldn’t be happier. Love the black canvas and olive coloured sole.
"Best shoes to skate in. Dont let the fashion police tell you not crease them, or scuff them, wear down the sole or put holes in them. I havent used an actual skate shoe, which includes the sb series, that feel better than AF1 while on a board."
These are not non tie ! Tried everything and can’t work it out
"First and foremost, these cleats are adorable! I had only ever seen them in adult sizes, but these small, child sized ones are so cute. 

The shoes are very light-weight and easy to put on. A little more ankle support would be nice, so maybe add a mid or high-top option? 

Very comfortable and sturdy shoe."
My son loves these cleats. They fit great and are comfortable. Look super cool too!
"This shoe has a very comfortable snug fit. The sole is super soft, with a reliable firm step. I might make these my every day shoe instead of MetCons from now on."
Love the shoe and the color. Great fit.
"The shoes are nice and light, so there is no need for further comment."
Sleek well built shoes.  My girls love them and love the colors. They say they are comfortable and cushioning and feel less of the runway.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My son seems to like them! They are light and comfortable
"My son is a sprinter, long jumper, and triple jumper. With triple jump, he needed something more stable for the 2nd and 3rd jumps. These have been the solution, and have also helped his long jump plant/launch. They don’t fit as snug around the heel as his traditional sprint spikes, but he likes them. The strap is an added bonus because he can easily loosen the shoes in between jumps to help with circulation."
Not really a running shoe. Not enough control over tightness
Really good shoes. Comfy and soft when running on road. No complaints so far. Though I only do about 5k max.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Decent shoe, however, wouldn't be fully convinced on the tongue/elastic laces. They have rubbed quite a bit above my ankle."
My favorite Nike sandal…very comfortable and easy to walk in…also looks great on the feet. This is my 3rd pair and I will always have this sandal in my wardrobe.
They fit nicely & quality is good . Easy slide on.
Goes with everything
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] i bought these for my son a month ago , he loves them! bought"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Daughter extremely satisfied with comfort of shoe!
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought this for my 6yo and he loves it!! Great fit

"Trail trainers are the future.
Brilliant for running and walking in all weathers.
Completely waterproof and I have the boot shaped trail trainers for the worst the British weather can throw at you.
Boot trainer one size larger.
Normal trainer half a size bigger."
"Great I love it 
I will definitely recommend for everyone"
"Being a fan of the trail 4 Goretex, I bought these for my partner. They're really comfortable and perfect for hiking, and outdoor short (10k and under) runs. Waterproof and stable shoe. No complaints!"
Ever day use for all occasions.
Cute sneaker at a nice price.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My toddler needed some shoes that were more durable and would also aesthetically be cuter than some of the cheap options. These knock it out of the park! She only wants to wear them lol Bonus: they’re super easy to put on and they stay on too,"
"Best shoes ever for flat feet!!!
My husband has been struggling with his flat feet. Sometimes he couldn’t even bend his knee; however, after he has been wearing this shoes, he is now able to walk like normal and bend his knees!! Amazing :)
Bought 5 of pairs already! He normally wears size 8.5-9 but he wears wide fit shoes, so we got 10 instead and fits perfect!"
"Very cool design, great color and very comfortable!"
Very easy to get on and off. Don't even really need to tighten em. Stay conformed on your foot so no slipping your heel out of. The soles are also way more comfortable than anything I've put on since the react element55's.
Cool kicks. I got all black for my 2 year old daughter so she has something to play in and get dirty. Only problem is these run small so she won't be able to wear them for long. It's already difficult to get them on and off of her so she won't end up getting much ise out of them. I would recommend getting at least a size bigger maybe even two sizes bigger just to be safe.
"Great really happy, much better then sliders he cant keep on his feet!"

It's nice and comfortable to wearing and very nice
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My son loves them. He’s using them for basketball and running in them with no problem.
Nice quality. True to size. Shoe stain easily. Hard to get back clean.
"I love the boots and they are my #1 go to now for work. I can work in a classy, nice looking boot."
I give 5 star for this shose very strong leather very nice it has carbon fiber layer on the bottom to make it strong and comfortable recommend for all
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Cool pair of Jordan boots for everyday very comfortable.
This is my second pair of these shoes. I love them! I bought another pair just to have in case they spot selling them not because something happened to the first pair.
"I love the look of these shoes in hand. They are so unique and the print that is on the sole of the shoe is so beautiful! However, I find that they either run a little large and are a bit bulky on foot. I'll still wear them when they match with my outfit but I do wish that I sized down one 1/2 size."
"Love the detail of the shoe very comfortable, and I'm loving this color which is my favorite !! And they had my size 😆"
They're the right sneakers for comfort. I bought the black ones and i am going to purchase another color. Love them fits perfect. Get your right size. I purchased the black ones.
"Great service from Nike, true to size trainer. Very pleased with the product"
Great Product. Great Price! Fast Shipping!
"For the price and the quality combined, I give these cleats a 10/10"
"Son loved shoes immediately look and feel. They arrived quickly, affordable and he was practicing in them same day which isn't always a guarantee."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Played few games with these on turf. They feel good once you break them in. I feel light on my feet with them.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My 15-year old son has a hard time finding cleats that aren’t too tight and width-wise and these have been comfortable for him. They have also held up well.
"Overall it s good pair of shoe for turf but can be better , as quality is very good but the fittment it a bit narrow...."
"forever a classic, couldn’t pass them up"
"Great shoes, great price, great deal"
Just like in 2003. Classic. And comfortable
I love this shoe. Very comfortable and true to size.
I just love how comfortable these shoes are!
Great looking pair of shoes for the wife. She loves them! Also bought at an awesome price as well.

"Are comfortable and look good, but had already started to crease before I even tried them on.  Not as high quality as my Jordan 1 Mid’s, which was expected for the price difference.  But disappointed that I bought new shoes and they already show signs of wear right out of the box."
"I waited several weeks to write this review, and boy I’m not disappointed! These are absolutely amazing! Incredible sneakers that I’ve become a big fan of! My favorite Jordans are the 3s, but these are right up there now! I have two color ways and will soon have another!!"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Purchased 2 different colorways of these mainly because of the mix of classic Jordan sneakers of the past. Comfortable on feet and I constantly get asked what Jordan's they are. Very happy with both purchases
These flip flops are so comfortable and adorable!!! I definitely recommend!!!
Comfy and good look
Best flip flop I’ve owned
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Exactly as pictured. Me and my boy are satisfied with them.
"These sneakers got really well fit my son, picking them up was easy to do. I would definitely buy these again."
"I love the colors, the material, and design. They look amazing on my son's feet."
When i put Them on they were so comfy . The tongue especially was nice and comfy . Definitely recommend.
"Love the (red/platinum) color, very comfortable and true to size. I purchased these as a “lifestyle” sneaker but b/c of the comfort, I can actually workout in these. Lots of toe room.  Highly suggest purchasing!"
Best water shoe Nike has put out thus far. The insole is was comfortable when wet. Quick drying webbing made shoe a good fit and not a soggy fit.
I am in love. Can’t wait to these babies off
"I love them! I bought apparently the last 10s and even though they are snug. Like not a bad snug, but they're awesome. I love the color too!!!!!"
Good looking and very confortable. The squeaking is extremely annoying. I want to love them but I often feel I am walking awkwardly to 'try to be quiet'.
"This pair of shoes just got delivered to my home and I tried them on immediately. I must admit that I feel like I’m walking on the clouds with these babies on. I just can’t wait to wear them at work. It’s a good thing I ordered them a half size up because they run a little on the small side. Besides that, these are one of the best for comfort."
These are the worst shoes I’ve ever worn. I bought them based off the looks. After a month they have zero support and squeak. I have never had a pair of shoes squeak like this. It’s insane! Do not buy these shoes!
These are not non tie ! Tried everything and can’t work it out
"First and foremost, these cleats are adorable! I had only ever seen them in adult sizes, but these small, child sized ones are so cute. 

The shoes are very light-weight and easy to put on. A little more ankle support would be nice, so maybe add a mid or high-top option? 

Very comfortable and sturdy shoe."
My son loves these cleats. They fit great and are comfortable. Look super cool too!

"Where have these been all my life? I almost cried when I put them on. I got in white, true to size. They have a HOKA Bondi 8 vibe but BETTER, CUTER, I will recommend to anyone. I'm converted! PS I just use these for walking, not running."
Very comfortable
Everyday shoe gym work
"Happy I bought my first pair of air max 95, this being my birth year holds a special place for me. I haven't had a pair of air maxes since high school so I will wear these proudly until I am sick of them. I am excited and want to continue Tommy Nike air max collection possibly with the Travis Scott next."
Pleasantly surprised with the comfort and support of these flip flops. Choosing another color soon.
These are very well constructed and they look really cute but know that they run a little small in width so if your child has wider feet definitely size up.
My kid loves these shoes says there very comfortable and durable would definitely recommend
We have the grey and pink shoes & love them. Super cute & fit perfect

"kinda loose fitting, but its very comfortable and definitely worth the price"
"I usually wear a size 10.5 so I tried a size 10 and 11. I ended up getting the 11 because it seemed like my foot fit the mold better. 
Pros; comfortable, stylish. 
Cons; They slip a lot without socks and they’re bulky."
Great product ı like it

"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My son has loved these for 100M hurdles, long jump and high jump."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It works great for track and field. I would recommend these sneakers.
"Good shoes, sizing is good, light weight but several spikes broke before first meet one even flattened out."
I Love These!! They are so different! I read other reviews to decide on the sizing. Most people were saying they ran a little big so I went down a half size. I normally wear a 7/5 but I got these in a 7 and the fit is perfect. They are very comfortable and stylish. Good purchase
I was truly surprised at the short time for delivery.
"I absolutely love these. The color is just as shown and my favorite. My true size is a 9.5. However, I typically purchase Nike in a 9.5 or 10. For these, I got mixed reviews so I went with my gut and sized down to a W 9. So glad I did, Perfect!!! The W 10 would have been too big."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great fit, support and cushioning My son loves them."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Awesome purchased! Great quality, I would recommend this seller."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Purchased over a month ago, and they are very supportive. My son loves the color and the wide toe box."
"Pure Garbage! They began falling apart 2 months after purchase, with only indoor walking around the office, never used outside. Nike is a Trash scompany."
Great shoes
"durability, fit, and good price!"
"Really good for volleyball, it has the grip you need and support cushioning."
They arrived on time and good condition correct size I love them I will be ordering again
Great fit completed the outfit 😁
"Run big so i down size big kids Luv the color and it make my legs look great but I wear a 6..5 but i purchased a white pair same size and didn't fit also purchaae a red pair same problem order from a different store which was finishline the red fIt great the second time first time was nike 
.com to small than white pair finishline to small I'm like confused"
I got these in red and they are so comfy I love the feeling #1 recommended shoe!
Very good looking shoes but tight fitting and not that much cushioning would not recommend to buy these
They look crazy along with a lions home jersey 🔥🔥🔥

"I had my previous Mercurial Superfly Pro type of boots which lasted for 5 years and these ones are not up to the quality... It is also really hard to put them on through its high-top - I almost need to wrestle it in (once inside, it fits well/ true to size, but really difficult to put them on). For this money I feel I am wearing some sort of engineered plastic, not to mention stability issues and lack of shooting precision. The experience overall is not satisfactory, at least not for this price. I have been a fan hence why I thought I will give this one a chance but after a couple of games - you've just lost a fan. I think it's a day-light robbery... Not sure if I would pay even half the price for these..."
"I’m having a great day. Found these on sale in the Nike outlet and wow these are amazing. I love the fit, it’s not tight or pressing and forms with my foot. The material is soft but also responsive. I also love the sole AG plate as it’s more comfortable to me than FG. Def recommend these."
My son loves them. By far most of his play is on AG surface with occasional FG play. The studs work great on both surfaces. An added benefit is the collar which has done excellent at preventing the annoying little rubber pellets from the AG turf from getting in the boot. Only wish they had the black in the Pro version available so I could have gotten a better price point - my son isn't complaining though:)
Young man says he loves them great grip and extremely comfortable
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got these a month ago the feel good on my feet the fit is perfect and that gray color is just Devine and I luv it r I luv them so much. Ha ha
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love the look of these shoes and the style with the green on black
Thanks . Having the size i need.
So comfortable for the price. Love the gold color.  I want another pair.  I said runs small but I just know when I buy Nikes I have to go up 1 size so that's not a problem.
Very nice looking shoe but ran larger than expected
"I love this shoe! I'm able to run longer distances while retaining the same comfort as the start. It's fast, durable, has sticky grip and has a nice wide toe box. Please make another colorway so I can buy a second pair to rotate."
"Exceptional grip, a responsive midsole, and great cushioning make this my favorite Nike trail shoe. 

While it isn't great for super technical or sloppy/muddy terrain (lugs aren't quite deep enough), it can handle the majority of trails well and you can't beat the combination of cushion and pop for once you are ready to pick up the pace! The Vibram outsole is a game changer for Nike trail shoes. 

I have 400 miles on the shoe and the midsole still has plenty of life left. Usually my shoes are ready to be retired at 300."
"These probably have to be one of the most comfortable trainers on the market that can also be worn as daily recovery/walking trainers too. The forefoot strike up hills/trail as others have mentioned feels a little stiff but not that this bothered me that much. Only gave 4 star as a couple of things that could be improved. 1. A little on the heavy side 2. The color/style of this trainer for a trail running has to be the most difficult to keep clean, two wet/muddy trail runs and they look like years of use due to the dirt stained to the shoes material. (does not come off that easy either) 
Other then that a fantastic dry trail shoe."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My son has very high arches and it's very difficult to find shoes that don't find pressure spots on the top of his feet, in addition he likes his velcro straps secured very snug. Needless to say finding shoes that work and fit is difficult but we love these. He wore them and there is plenty of space for his high arches and we can still strap them down the way he likes. We tried on and purchased in store. Also, very cute and love the black with black sole."
I normally size up for my son because his foot is wide. They look great and jordan always holds up well with a toddler that runs around all day
Love the look and fit.
Super comfortable shoes can wear casual and look great as business casual. I've got tons of Nike shoes these are up there with 270s as far as comfort. Great fit with the laces tied or not. Easy to clean. 10/10 sneaks for any occasion.
"I bought my boyfriend the yellow ones. He unfortunately can't wear them at this moment but when he comes home he will have them on prolly everyday. But in his words when he seen them in person was ""those are Fire babe""."

These cuties arrived today and I love them. I wear a Women’s 8.5 in the Air Force 1s and the Blazers but because of the reviews I ordered a 9 in these and they are perfect. They have great support and they feel extra pillowy on my feet. They hug my feet in a good way.
"They look really nice on but the first fit is kind of tight, I need to break these in"
Love it!!!❤️❤️this is the only shoes I wear for tennis hard court the cushion is fabulous and that is the reason why I love this shoes so much. I just wish it come in wider
"I absolutely love the look of these shoes and wanted them to work. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong, but I couldn’t get them on my foot. The ratio of the size of the shoe and my foot did not match with the size of the opening to get my foot in there. Additionally, there isn’t really any stretch around the opening very confused and sad."
"Doesn't live up to the Peg Turbo name. The scraps of Zoom X foam used is like a dense, firm, and hard version of it. They should've just named this Pegasus next nature. Those of us who ran in the previous versions of the Peg Turbo know how good a running shoe that was an this doesn't come anywhere close."
"The shoe is very comfortable.  My major complaint is the outer sole is very thin and wears fast. I am a heavy heal striker, but I wore through the  outer sole in 50 miles.  I add sheet metal screws to the corners after about 200 miles normally, so I won't buy this style again.  I've had a least 3 pairs of Pegasus every year since they came out."
"Alphafly 2 has been my only running shoe, so I’m sorry to see it appears to be on the way out. I hope the 3 is just as good. I love the booty fit without the need to deal with a loose tongue. Grab the loops at the top and back to slip on more easily. The laces did dig into the top of my feet, but problem solved with a Lydiard-style lacing (see photo)."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought these to replace my old model. They are super light and comfortable. Great for running. Best running shoes I have. Only thing is that they are a little hard to out on and remove. Fits true to size 6.5. But overall very good. Love them.
"definitely PB shoes. hard to put on, which makes it feel like wrapping your feet during the run. Thumps up.  It does give you lots push forward power when you running. This shoes require very strong calves. if you new runner or beginner please take a second thought about purchasing it."
"These are for my picky 11year old son that has played basketball for years. He loved the fit of this shoe because his ankle’s had room for movement which made him feel more flexible on the court. He said the feel was comfortable with the inside padding. The design is smooth he normally goes for bright color shoes but these are a classic look he enjoyed! The fabric is soft inside and firm on the outside great material. The very bottom of the shoe is great on the indoor court because of the grip. This was his favorite part about the shoe. Only change I might add is a this same shoe in different colors, they might already offer this I just haven’t seen them. 10/10 would recommend for an experienced or new ball player."
"My step son, [Name removed], is a walking three-point threat. He lives and breathes hoops, and his shot is already pure silk (well, maybe like training wheel silk for now, but it's getting there!). So, finding the right shoe for his game was crucial. Enter the Nike GT Cut 3 – game changer!

First Impression: These shoes are sleek and sporty, with a design that [Name removed] immediately dubbed ""super cool."" He loved the pop of color and the futuristic vibe even with the all black and green accent shoe. I appreciated the quality materials and the sturdy build – these shoes scream ""ready to play hard.""

 On the Court: [Name removed] took to these like a duck to water. The lightweight design gave him the speed he craves for those lightning-fast cuts to the three-point line. The traction is unreal – he plants his feet and launches with total confidence. He even swears the shoes make his shots swish a little louder (maybe it's just his imagination, but hey, confidence is key!).

 Support & Comfort: As a parent, I was worried about ankle support for his growing feet. But the GT Cut 3's mid-top design and snug fit have him covered. He says they're super comfy, even after hours of practice. Plus, the breathable mesh keeps his feet cool, which is a major win in our sweaty household.

 Overall: [Name removed] has gone from ""three-point hopeful"" to ""three-point machine"" thanks to these shoes. The Nike GT Cut 3 has given him the confidence, support, and speed he needs to take his game to the next level. They're definitely worth every penny for any young baller who dreams of draining threes like Steph Curry. Five out of five stars, easy!"
"My daughter loves how these sneakers are easy to slip on and how it feels. Bonus, it matches everything for a soon to be middle schooler!"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It is hard to find a size 15 so I was excited to find these for our son. They are comfortable and appear to be able to hold up well.
Very comfortable
Awesome!!!
Love the boot very  Comfortable
Extremely comfortable. I sized up from 9 to 9.5!
"Very comfortable, flexible and fit like a gym shoes. Right amount of support at the ankles, without being restricted. Currently being used in a hospital, for 12 hours a day and they are the most comfortable boot I have used."
Great shoe. Easy on & off. Comfortable & stylish.
Bought it for my son
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My kid loves them ! They are so cute and confi they run perfect size too
Horrible it broke after the third wear. It also does not stay tied
I think they look great and are comfortable. Took a little getting used to.
Absolute heat🔥🔥🔥I love these so much. I been hooping in them for around 2.5 months and they are so comfortable and just an overall fire shoe!
Good Quality shoe. The color is nicer in person.
Nice fit and goes with everything. Needed a new pair and went with the gum bottom
"Timeless, classic shoes.  Goes with everything and comfortable.  Would definitely buy again"
They are huge and different but I love them they are so comfortable  they are definitely a style statement. My Grandchildren call them Roblox Jordan's. They are nice I got two more colors.
Love my new Nike they are comfortable and a perfect fit. They look great on and I can walk long distances with no pain or cramping of toes.
"I was in need of comfortable shoes, preferably for everyday wear and walking. I only owned Converse and wore those everywhere but later realized those are the wrong shoes to wear for travel and walking (especially after spending all day at Disneyland)! Saw these shoes on the site and thought they were cute. Reviews mentioned great comfort so I thought why not. I am so happy I got these! These arrived in time for my trip the following day. I didn't need to break these in; they were super comfortable since day one. I wore them throughout my trip and my feet were ache free the whole time. It is especially important to me to wear comfortable shoes to the airport and on the plane so these were perfect. Reviews about sizing were inconsistent however I stuck with my usual size 7.5 and it was perfect."
"The shoes seem fine, however could not wear them as they are soooo big. at least a sz bigger than what's listed. Not sure how durable they are, as I have to return and re-order in a smaller sz."

"I absolutely love these shoes,  these are a must have for your sneaker collection. There very comfortable and I've gotten alot of compliments."
My favorite Jordans to purchase are the Mids! I absolutely love this color and they are so comfortable to wear. Also true to size for me.
This is my second pair.I get so many compliments! Love the color combination.
LOVE the super comfortable flip flops. This is the second time purchasing them..lost one in the pond last year. They fit great and are soft between the toes.
"I wanted the celso but my size hasn't been available in months, so I settled for the Bella kai I like them they're comfortable I'm picky on my flip-flops I would buy these again"
I love these! Comfortable & stylish
This shoe is amazing and I would recommend
This is not a very good shoe for tennis is heavy and feels like it’s weighing you down and doesn’t help you be light on your feet and move quickly.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this two weeks ago and the shoes are very comfortable and good sizing.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Got these for my daughter and she loves them we got a black pair and a red pair
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Really nice fit. I bought at a ,great price!!! Will purchase in more colors"
"Shoe fits true to size, looks great on your feet, turns heads, and is comfortable.will definitely buy other colors of this same style."
True to size perfect 6th birthday gift for my son! First pair of Jordan’s he’s owed & he loves them!
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love them. Great with any outfit. I only wear on special occasions

Very comfortable shoe!!!! My toddler loved it he’s 4 years old. Still has room in the shoe!
"They were the cutest shoes on my step daughter, she just loves them"
These Nike dunks look really nice on my son. My son really likes the color scheme on them and he said they are comfortable.
"Definitely some good cleats, kinda hard putting them on at first but it’ll become easy as you go on. They look good and when you look good you feel good, I definitely recommend they’re definitely worth getting in my opinion so go for it."
Definitely comfortable!  Ordered size down and was a perfect fit. Not heavy but solid you know you’re wearing a good shoe. Perfect for everyday i wear them to work I don’t like to take them off.  I want a second pair.
"Go a whole size down with these. These are my favorite lounging slide. I love the platform and the overall study quality of these slides. Please don’t stop making this style. I have 3 pairs total. I ordered 2 pairs in my normal size I wear across Nike and Jordan sneakers. Although, I realized they were large, I wore them a LOT! For my third pair I decided to order a whole size down just to see how they would fit, and they fit perfectly. So order 1 down. Other than that, I highly recommend these. They are not heavy to me, like some other people mentioned, but I’m used to platform shoes and sandals. I think they are perfect."
"Cute, comfy and true to size. Great color will go with everything!"
Boyfriend loves them.Says the fit very well and are very comfortable. Style is great.
"I wear the shoes 4 times to go to work, a desk job, and they ripped on both shoes. It looks like I’ve had the shoes for almost 6 months or so."
Comfortable and stylish
Beautiful
Got them for my son!!! They are a really nice fit an go with anything
Product in awesome condition.
Best spikes ever. Cant wait till this years xc spikes come out. Buying as soon as they are out. They are extremely comfortable and durable.
"A very pleasant spike for both the track and on cross country courses, a bit heavier than the track dragonflies but made for the extra wear and tear of cross country, would make a good steeplechase spike."
"Love the fit and comfort of the shoe. I haven't previously used these unique spikes so was intrigued. They are superb. Ran in a major Cross country event last weekend and they held firm in the soft, wet, muddy ground and I felt confident running up and down hills. The size was perfect."
🔥 🔥 I'm glad I got mine! They definitely look better in person
🔥 shoe great quality look even better in person
One of my favorite pickup this year so far. I wish they would have came out in the fall.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I wear my shoes while at Sports Card Trading Shows. Being on my feet for 6-8 hours, this shoe is the most comfortable and stable shoe I have. Better than my Brooks or OC’s and even better than other Nike’s I own. My only recommendation, get a 2nd pair. This way you can keep the shoes nice and fresh and not getting odor from too much use."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great fit, stylish, and easy to move in. Very flexible."
I think they look great and are comfortable. Took a little getting used to.
"Had the Pegasus Trail 3, which was an excellent shoe and these are even better. Thanks Nike!"
"Absolutely the best Nike shoe I have ever had. Super comfortable, can wear all day, from hiking, to walking and working. Will definitely keep buying these shoes! Fit is perfect and has amazing grip."
"Great shoes! Got in promotion, making it even better!! Highly recommend! Great experience so far! Works great for running in every kind of environment"

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this a month ago for my daughter and she couldn’t be happier with them. She didn’t have any trouble breaking them in and enjoys the look of them.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Daughter really like them and says very comfortable also likes the color way
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Kid loves them…says they are very comfortable and cool
"We bought these basketball shoes for my 12 year old son. He slides everywhere as they have no traction (truly none). We tried a grip spray, but decided to order the basketball shoes he had previously."
Shoe runs extremely small and narrow.  So disappointed that they don’t fit.
When you first put the shoe on it is narrow at the front part of the upper foot. Once you break the shoe in it will go away. The shoe does fit snug but comfortable at the same time. I will suggest going to have size up if you don't want the shoe to snug on your feet.
Good quality and a nice fit for air max brand
Always been in Love with these shoe. Runs a little small order half a size up!
Best tns I have got need to release them again and in more colours
Love these shoes!! Excellent fit and cool look!! I would wear these all day if I could!!
"Very very comfortable!!
I’m a bus operator and wanted a pair of shoes instead of a boot.
They’re lightweight and have excellent support.
I’m only 5’4 and with the shoes I’m a little taller and feel really supportive with these shoes.
They match my uniform.
Purchasing another pair .💕"
"I love these shoes. They are so comfortable and light. Amazing. They run a bit large, so I purchased .5 size smaller."
"These sandals are comfortable, but you should definitely size up."
Very good for wide feet. Good for activities like cardio etc.
Playing tennis in these shoes I forget about my feet. That's all I need from a shoe.
"I bought these for work. I usually wear running shoes, so I was afraid they weren’t going to be comfortable to wear all day. They were a little stiff at first, no blisters or anything like that, but they did quickly wear in and I’ve had no comfort issues. Here’s what impressed me most about these shoes. I’m in California and we just experienced some historical storms that caused widespread, catastrophic flooding. One whole area inside the facility I work at had so much water, we were literally sloshing through it. Didn’t even dawn on me until my co-workers were complaining about their feet and socks being wet, that mine were completely dry! I don’t know how many days we were working to contain the water and clean it all up, but my feet/socks never got wet during any of it, while my co-workers had to bring a change of shoes and socks with them everyday. I couldn’t believe it! I am so impressed with the quality and material of these shoes. I will never go back to running shoes. (Unless I’m buying them for actual running.)"
The kicks are so comfortable I love the color
"I likes the style of the shoe. I ordered a whole size up because they run pretty narrow. Overall, love the shoe."
I wear these all the time! These are a classic. The gold + reflective is super cool and the comfort is great!
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My son loves them. We got them for indoor baseball training and he said the felt great.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My grandson loves Jordan shoes and clothes. Good quality.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought these for my son to wear to school. They fit great and he’s able to run and play in them.
I love ittttttt I love itttttt
Fit perfect! Exactly the same color as in the picture.... My daughter loves ❤️ them!!
Look amazing and beautiful colourways
I really loved these shoes for my son. It has my favorite color (teal). The combination of colors was nice.
"With more cushion,  these sliders are more comfortable than regular sliders. True to size."
Ordered two sizes up based on other people’s reviews and these fit perfectly. It feels like I’m walking on clouds.
I ordered my normal shoe size and they were too small. Even though Nike has a great return policy I didn't return them. So I ordered two sizes larger and they fit perfectly.
My daughter loves them! They have held up through 2 seasons of classic soccer which far exceeded my expectations. The ankle is not loose and they haven’t slipped once. My daughter plays GK so lace-free shoes are amazing!
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We bought a few weeks ago and my daughter loves them. They feel great, but run a little small."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought these for my son he loves them says comfortable and light wearing them .
Needed a white and black pair of kicks for a day party that was coming up. I ordered these and they worked really well with my outfit and made a bold and subtle statement
"Awesome shoe, accurate description, great shipping time!"
"Product is comfortable, lightweight and goes with anything. Shipping was fast."
"Shoe is very comfortable, fits well, and it is light. I have been playing 3-4 times per week and it has been holding up pretty well.
I will definitely get another one."
"I own pretty much every tennis shoes or did owned em over the years that Nike put out since good Ol days of ATC series to Oscilates till present era of Vapor 11 or Pros .Gotta say these are one of my favorite after couple of plays ,light grippy enough and not clunky like Vapor Pro 2 ,Also resembles my favorite shoes from Agassi era ATC 3 and 4highly recommend"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these for my son for tennis he says they are incredibly comfortable and they look nice too!
"The sneakers 👟 look 👀 so much better in person!! The colors POP and they look good on my Grandson, Santana! I love them 😍"
My son love the shoes
Love the colors a fit

I want to give these a 5 star rating I really do. The only problem I have with them is the tongue on both boots has split open at the stitching. And there could be more grip on the bottom. Fix those issues and this is the perfect boot. I wear these for work in the private security field and have literally worn them from Miami to seattle to LA and put a lot of miles on them.
"Bought these over the winter in North Carolina. They’ve held up pretty good. Taken them on light hikes and used them at work which doesn’t entail being outside that much. They’re water resistant but didn’t run them through deep puddles or any streams. They’re absolutely grippy outdoors but have absolutely no grip if you’re walking anywhere indoors after getting the outsole wet. They did a nice job on keeping my feet warm and dry, but now that the weather is getting warmer I don’t really use them. As far as sizing goes, they're not really true to size, if anything they run about a half size up. But these are perfect for anyone with wide feet. They’re very comfortable and almost no break in is needed. And they’re not actual boots, more like a sneaker’s take on a boot. I got the black ones which went well with everything. Oh, and other than the small creases that it came with out of the box, no complaints."
Please bring these out in coyote brown so I can wear them in uniform again. Not everything has to be AR670 compliant. These were my favorite boots in the Air Force. Yes the soles wear out quicker than I want but they are the most comfortable boots I have ever worn.
Very good shoe 👟 is strong and comfortable at the same perfect for younger who loves to be running and jumping around all the time. I definitely recommend it.
Great show love the design fits nice
Comfortable… gonna take time to get used to the newness ☺️
I love them . They are so comfortable! Going to get every pair for the summer.
So very comfortable from day 1. Easy to just slip my feet in and go. Dressy enough to-wear  with skirt or dress. Color is awesome
I was using this project at the gym but they weren't comfortable to work out in so I gave them to someone that liked them.
Wear them everywhere everyday! This is my 3rd pair snd will be buying the same next time. Creature of habit.
Wear for going out with my wife
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My child likes the shoe and it is a very durable shoe.
Great quality. Nice colors. My son loves them. True to size. It’s a win ! The shipping arrived be try quickly as well.
Very great shoe. I really enjoy playing basketball in these and  I would highly recommend them.
Love my new runners!! They are really comfortable and i love the colours.
Really nice trainers love the colours! Little snug at first so needs little wearing in to make more comfortable.
"Comfortable shoe. Although I do a lot of trail running these were more for commuting / on the dog walk. Plenty of toe room although it you have a high instep like me, slightly tight on the upper foot. Really lovely looking shoe."
"The shoes are perfect!  I honestly thought they were going to be more black, but they are a dark brown, almost black.  They have a fleck in them also.  I absolutely love them.  I had two compliments on them the first day I wore them!"
Love these.  Much more comfortable than the all leather model.  Lots of cushion in the heel and I love the puffy style tongue and reflective laces.  I hope Nike continues to use these materials.
Have to return them because the fit was a bit large compared to my other Nikes. My heel keeps slipping out of the shoe no matter how tight I tie my laces. They look nice and seem comfy though.
I always buy Nike Cortez just an old school trainer that I have many pairs in different colours.

Great style and feels really comfortable I'm happy with these Air Force 1's Air Max Combination Sneaker just the perfect style for me
"Very comfy soles, sharp looking and they go with about everything. Here’s the reason I gave them a three star rating. I bought these because they were sharp and I had owned the originals from 82, but these seem to be more plastic than real leather on the uppers. I wish I paid better attention before I wore them. Real leather like the originals wears better, is more comfortable and it breathes better than plastic."
Fit was not good.
"I should have gone a half size up because they run a little small. I was also hoping they had just a bit more cushion. As for on the trail they’re great, had no issues. They have good traction with hard surfaces, sandy, and rocky terrain."
Love the shoes a little tight on the top but overall great runner. 5 starts because my daughter love the box
"I was looking for shoe & everything seems the same ..... I remember, I use to wear running shoes back the day ( Nikes ) this is how I came across item ..... Now , I don't run in the rain or trails ..... Just looking for something different with style as a walking shoe ..... For my needs * this shoe don't disappoint ..... In hopes ""* this type of shoe will be my next go to ...... Shoe do run small , so that extra 1/2 size count ..... I like"
Terrible golf shoe. Feels like concrete buckets in your feet. Its a basketball golf hybrid minus the golf part. Cool design but need to be a little more light weight
The golf division is crushing it. I wish the lifestyle group would follow and release some of these same shoes. These are sweet looking

"These are comfortable and waterproof, but they crease easily, and the color started to wear off the back of the shoe after wearing them only a few times. I already have several small spots where white spots are showing through. I don't think these shoes are built to last."
Had to get these the color in person absolutely gorgeous. It’s a must for my collection.
Really good looking shows they look so much better in real life and waterproof really stylish shoes💧
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought two sizes in this. The women's 10 was large and roomy on my forefoot, much more so than the FK version. I always wear a 10 in the Pegasus and Infinity React/RN series. The 9.5 was too tight-so I'm not sure what was going on, but I'm going to pass on the shoe. 
The shoe itself was beautiful, I wish it had worked. The purple/blue color was really nice in real life. The inside was fleecy soft and gore-tex upper was not as flexible as the flyknit, but very well done for a wet weather shoe."
"Look great, got them in pink, comfortable fit!!"
So comfortable!
"I have narrow feet and these are extremely tight in the middle of the foot to the base of my toes. The ankle on the other hand is too big and the shoes are loose at the ankle. I’ve only been wearing them for 2 days and hope the middle of the shoes will widen out a bit through wear. The shoes look great, but fit is not for me"
"looks great on/off the court. comfortable shoe with a decent arch, something that's really rare. 
true to size for me (although many review states it's snug). 
wish it was more breathable and lighter, but overall very pleased."
"When first time put shoes on, the toe part is a bit narrow (left and right, top and bottom) but after 3-5days break in, it feels good!
The shock absorption is not good, but enough for commute. 
Traction perfect, even in a bit ash indoor court
recommend go half size up"

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these a month ago for my daughter who is in track great quality
"I’m gonna be honest I do sprints and hurdles, but the work perfect! They are so comfortable. I don’t think I’ll ever be changing spikes, 10/10 recommend. All the sprinting ones are plastic and I don’t like that. The cushion is perfect."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This distance shoe is the perfect fit for a good distance run.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these, by the first time I used them they already felt comfortable, like a sock. I would recomend."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these for my son who plays national level soccer. He really likes the mercurial style. With practices/games 5-6 days a week, he needs comfortable and durable shoes. He likes be color, we had seen them in the store. Online states the shoes are “yellow”, it’s really more an off white."
Customized initials and numbers peeled off after 1 light practice. Looks like they were just slapped on and not UV-treated-or what ever the curing process should be.
"Great timing with shipping, love the color way, great slides, and great bengals fan gear, fits mostly true to size, maybe order a half size up."
The shoes run extremely small
I like the service how fast it came n the style of the shoe my son love it it's none to dislike about them or the service
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Grandson loves the easy style of putting on and off. Also loves Jordan style
This item fit my baby perfect I am so in love with it thank you guys for always having the right fit and the right product for our bouncing babies
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I'm so happy with the product will order in the future
Awesome shoe. Fits great. Comfortable and stands out
The shoe was so soft and I kick so good with it last the color looks good
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very solid shoe. Made well and my son loves using them. We'd recommend them.
My 3 year old has cerebral palsy and has to wear hinged AFO braces in order to bear weight on his feet. It’s so hard to find shoes that fit over these braces and these are the only ones I’ve ever found that do the job while being easy to put on. They seem to be made a little wider than other styles and last forever. Please never stop making these!
"Daughter loves them comfy wears all the time for the playground , she always finds them comfy and always wants to wear them"
Comfortable and the shoes are easy on and off.
"I've had these for less than a month, about 3 weeks, and the right shoe already has several holes in it. Overall they are very comfortable – but if you use them for anything other than just walking, they do not last."
"I have been wearing roshes since they came out. They have always been my favorite shoes I’ve ever had. They are extremely comfortable, lightweight, and they are a great design. My only problem with them is that, as of right now, there are not enough color patterns. I have four pairs right now and I would like some more color options or a customizable one. 10/10 would highly recommend."
"Pretty comfortable, and looks pretty good! I would try to get them for under retail! $50 and under would be a great buy!"
"I am enjoying my sneakers. They are sleek, stylish and comfortable!"
"Comfortable and Great style, easy to put on and they stay on very well with the elastic holding the tung right where it supposed to be."
"LOVE everything about them. Comfort, style and fit."
"At first try, these fit very snug across the front of the foot.  I put on super thin socks and then it was perfect.  By perfect I mean these were the most supportive and responsive court shoe I’ve ever worn!  Excellent court shoe and will definitely buy again.  High arches will need inserts but overall excellent support!!"
I play pickleball 4 times a week for about 3 hours each time. At first shoes felt a little snug. After about an hour of playing the feeling went away. One of my favourite shoes so far. I go through new pair every 3-4 months.
"4.5 player honestly love everything about the shoe. The outsole has the perfect grip for indoor/outdoor. The insole feels very comfortable and is the only pickleball shoe i dont have to use custom orthotics. They feel light which is perfect for singles play. Only complaint is they’re really narrow in the midfoot, i even bought half a size up but they are still so snug."
Beautiful shoe but they Run small.
Great shoe’s comfortable and pretty slick love them
Please provide 9 and 9 1/2. Thank you. Very beautiful shoes.
"Did a plyometric session in these and they were great. Very cushioned and the carbon plate in the shoe gives good feedback. Kept my foot stable and secured. Bounding felt great in these. I have not competed in them yet, so we will see. I'm usually a size 10.5 but ordered an 11 because they do run small. The 11 was fine for me so I wouldn't worry about ordering a size up."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very light, with lots of cushion and great stability"
"I normally wear a women's size 7 to 8, depending on the shoe. I first ordered these in M 6.5/W 8 and my toes were up against the front of the shoe. I then ordered M 7/W 8.5 and they are still a bit too short. I'll be ordering the M 7.5/W 9 to try next. So definitely go up a full size in these. 

Size aside, the shoes are very light-weight, which I was particularly looking for. The heel is just thick enough to handle the impact taken during the TJ. I am really looking forward to getting a size that truly fits so that I can wear them jumping."
"I got these in mid Oct 2023 and only wore on rainy days until it got cold- mid Dec. Up until that time , I loved these sneakers! They’re very comfortable and supportive and VERY waterproof and warm. Perfect for walking in the city during the very cold , wet, and slippery winter. My plan was to buy another pair but then , after daily wear through January they literally fell apart! The fabric side of one shoe completely split open. I’ve worn Nikes for many years and have never had this issue. This is unacceptable , especially since I’m only walking in them , and I’m 71 years old, so only walking outside for an hour a day! I expected these to last at least an entire year. I’ve had other Nikes that have lasted 2 years. I’m very disappointed and would love either Nike or Nordstrom to make good on these obviously defective sneakers!"
"Great comfort, color and style, but the waterproof “shield” material makes them too darn noisy! Noise was less of a squeak and more of a sound similar to folding plastic - like squeezing a plastic water jog. I didn’t realize I was buying the “shield” version until til they arrived - will not purchase another shield style."
"Got them today, they look great, comfy, my feet feel secured in them with full confidence my feet wouldnt get wet. Except,  I listened to the reviews about sizing up a half or full size. Mistake on my part. Seems like Nikes runs true to size (depending on the person's feet I guess) mine are swimming in these. Im usually a 7.5 and got an 8. Ill have return them, Unfortunately, they're all out of size 7.5. Bummer. Giving it 4 stars bc they do make a loud popping sound...shouldn't matter if you're running in them though."
"Colorway is a tad darker in person than pictures , otherwise great shoe"
The shoe looks much better in person than in the picture. The the colors in the picture are much brighter then what you get. What you get is toned down. It's a great shoe and I think these pictures hurt the shoe. Easy to pair with clothing. Very happy with them. Find other pictures on line.
"The first thing you will notice from this shoe is the immense quality, it’s entirely suede. It’s also super comfortable. And this color-way is so subtle yet sublime. I’m a happy camper 😃"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is the fourth pair I bought for my daughter. She loves shoes.
Nice sneaker for my granddaughter.. would buy again.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great, you bought multiple pairs for my kids they love them multiple colors cool colors wear well fast delivery fast fast fast delivery"
My son absolutely loves his spikes....
"Great looking, perfect fit and excellent for throwing."
This is the best javelin shoe I ever had. Superb quality and the shoes at night looks super clean.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] they were very good quality, they are way much prettier in person i loved them."
The shoes are awesome in every way ! Nice fit comfortable and very stylish! I can’t wait to buy my next pair at the party all eyes were on me and my kicks !
Bought these for my daughters birthday she was so happy

"First of all, super comfortable shoe. I deal with foot pain, especially in the forefoot, and these shoes are one of the most comfortable shoes I have. For tennis purposes, you can hit, serve, and practice in these shoes, but you won’t be able to make any hard cuts or quick sprints without feeling like the shoe is going to explode. This is because they use a soft mesh material for the upper that doesn’t have much lockdown, but it had amazing heat dissipation. These shoes are my warmup/practice shoe before starting my match. I have 2 pairs and don’t regret my purchases at all."
Perfect fit look great comfortable great colours Nike tick ✔️ on soul of shoe looks good
One of the best and most comfortable tennis shoes
My favorite color and I can make any shirts or pants with my shoes
I rebought them because it was rare for them to be on the site again. The box came real good and easy to open.
LOVE LOVE LoVE these shows and they are so comfortable
"No complaints, comfortable shoe, goes great with my uniform."
"This shoe is incredible! The airmax Ap is SUPER comfortable, and has maintained it’s tread very well.  I was dealing with nasty foot discomfort and tried other Major competitors brands and inserts for my  sneakers and they never helped with my foot pain. Then comes along the girl in the shoe store and she suggested these in navy blue and white. I bought them and the rest is history. I LOVE THESE."
"I got this shoes a few years back but did not started wearing them until a few months ago since I bought multiple other kind of shoes, but when I wore them one of the air pockets popped which sucks could not return them since 60 days passed."
These shoes are so grippy and great!!!!! Would recommend if you are a center! I am 6’9 and I really enjoy these!
I love these shoes. The design and they're so comfortable
"Just a good shoe. If you're on the fence about these shoes then rest assure, this one is for you."
These shoes are fantastic. Very stable and a great fit. I have received many compliments on the course as well. Would buy again!
"Overall it’s a great shoe, looks good and feels good, first time wearing it felt a bit tight but it got looser, one thing that I don’t like is that these shoes crease very easily and doesn’t look good with the creases, other than that, it’s a good shoe to buy"
"I love everything about these kicks!!! 
I usually buy half sizes in all of my shoes but these only came in an 11. However, the fit was PERFECT!"
"Average comfort, but everyone compliments on the color combination"
"Very comfortable, but not very durable, you should definitely have two pairs of shoes to wear other than these"
Love it. The style. The color. The texture. The fit.
"Just received mine and they are fire!! fit perfect i am a 8.5 not to narrow on my toes like some nikes, super comfortable! color is more a nude and light muted pink love the color combo. so glad i pulled the trigger and got these for my collection"

Shipped fast and quick....thank you finish line
"Great solid base with a high quality materials, definitely get size down"
"I purchased these boots a long time ago, and only wore them for 1 year. Great boot! BUT like all the other comments mention, the laces literally cut right through the loop. Extremely poor design. Shame because I HAD to chuck them and they had a lot of life left in them. RIP to this boot style I won’t buy it again."
"I own 3 pairs. 2 pairs of SFB 2, and a pair of the SFB 3. 

These are probably the best shoes I've ever owned in terms of style comfort, and durability. 
I'm going to keep buying these for decades to come, if available.

I get complimented constantly. You can wear them with athletic gear, or dress up a bit with business casual attire and they look great.

I bought my first pair in China in 2018 and would walk ~5 miles a day on the city streets every single day during the winter... 6 years later and they are (clearly worn in, but) still in phenomenal shape.

In terms of dollars per hour on my foot, they are the cheapest shoes I've ever purchased.

Btw, I wear an 11.5 in men's and I have a more narrow than average foot. I thicker wool socks to compensate... I can do 12-13 hours on these boots on a hard surface day after day and I feel ""very decent"" at the end of it. They are super comfy, durable, and ultra lightweight as far as boots go. I can jog or dead run in them. My hip flexors never ache (a common issue if I wear heavier boots).

I really really wish they would bring back the Green version. They are so cool!"
Perfect Daily sneakers run small so get a 1/2 up other than that ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
"The ACG Moc 3.5 slides right on and is so secure when walking, it is a very comfortable and keen design. I was able to go hiking, go workout and even go to work in these. The shoe was comfortable enough to wear all day and is easily the most comfortable shoe in my closet. The design is very elegant and very unique because being a moccasin it hugs your foot and makes walking effortless. The thing I liked most about the shoe was how comfortable they were and how simple they were to put on they are very accessible to all types. One thing I’d like to see added to it is more designs on the shoe itself I really like how it is made out of recycled and how the box itself is a recyclable."
"The Nike ACG Moc 3.5, as the “.5” moniker suggests, is an iterative update to the ACG 3.0. Most of the features found on the 3.0 have stayed largely the same, but some changes I’ve noticed include a quilted ripstop upper now with a parallelogram- or diamond-shaped pattern instead of the previous triangle-shaped pattern on the 3.0, a revised heel strap that now sits more flush with the shoe, a change to the front mudguard now being made of what feels like a synthetic suede, and more use of Nike’s recycled ""Grind"" rubbers on the front and rear portions of the outsole. There do not appear to be any visible changes to the outsole traction pattern.
 
Outside of those changes, the ACG Moc 3.5 continues to be a great, versatile slip-on shoe (thus the “moc” name) that’s comfortable to be used for a wide-variety of casual uses, including running errands around town or lounging around the house (or around a campfire). Its cushioning is a touch on the firmer end but not overly so, and its light weight thanks to its construction materials means my feet don’t experience any fatigue after long days wearing them. The 3.5 is also pretty easy to clean thanks to its ripstop upper, so it can definitely be used in wetter weather. This is NOT a hiking or performance shoe and should not be used for such purposes. 

So, all in all, the ACG Moc 3.5 is a great, all around lounging/house shoe that is easy to slip on, fairly durable, and stays comfortable to wear for hours."
Came on time great shoes
Both my pair of shoes fit awesome
They are comfortable on my son and he lovexthe way they look. They do get dingy if you do not take care of them but all in all they are good.
No reviews available
Nice looking trainer but the toe split after about 4 hrs play. Starts with a crack then slowly opens up. Probably be in the bin after a month. Shame because they look and feel good
Very good purchase to up your tennis game. Great grip and ability to slide.
"Super supportive shoe, great grip on outdoor courts, and minimal break in period. Great looking shoe as well."
"Big fan of the feel, and are a noticeable upgrade for me, although would suggest more for wide receivers and the likes since backpedaling feels off."
"Very pleased with the product, fit and performance."
Absolutely needs to be more durable. If you are cutting with a lot of force beware of the plate breaking.
