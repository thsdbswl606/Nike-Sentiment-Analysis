review
My son loves these and uses them for gym class but the durability and quality is absolutely not there. The whole shoe is coming apart after only a few months. The front has these thread like fibers that are expanded and just not up to par with Nike quality. I would suggest going with another sneaker if you‚Äôre looking for something to last a little more than a few months
"Do not recommend.  My son has worn 4 times and toe cap is completely ripping off.  Insole has also come out.   Very poorly made shoe, not worth it."
My son has worn various versions of Star Runners for years now. They are his daily shoes but this most recent pair has substantially worn away the tread in less than 3 months of wear. His previous pairs' soles were all still generally intact by the time he outgrew them (much longer than 3 months). I would be hesitant to buy another pair of these if this is the current state of durability.
They are more comfortable I recommend them ü•∞
versatile and comfortable v happy
"While I love these shoes and get a ton of complements on them. These took 4 whole months to break in (wearing them only once a week). I find them extremely comfortable now, but just be warned that these will feel incredibly tight and clunky for a while until you can break them in. That being said. I probably would buy them again. I find myself reaching dor them often now."
"Got the product, definitely glad i went a half size up from my normal size that i go for when it comes to Nike shoes (they fit similar to vans on the length). Kinda feels tight on the width so i wouldnt recommend for wide footed people, i think it should break in fine for me once i wear it a few times though. Also, expect the packaging to be barebones and minimum with no return label included for sustainability."
The shoes are really dope. I ordered my mom two pair because she really liked mine. She doesn't wear sneakers. Says a lot. ü§åüèæ
"i absolutly love these, they fit well and they look great.
They are well made.. I bought them in all white also"
Absolutely LOVE them! üíöüòç Even better in person!
I love the color the fit is good
Love these!! The green is gorgeous.
Great Product. Great Price! Fast Shipping!
"For the price and the quality combined, I give these cleats a 10/10"
"Son loved shoes immediately look and feel. They arrived quickly, affordable and he was practicing in them same day which isn't always a guarantee."
Nice shoe but the size runs small and is very narrow on the sides of my feet.Will be returning these shoes for a different type of running or training pair.
They match my hat
Comfortable & sturdy. Fits true to size. Would buy again.
"They are so comfortable!! I love how reasonably priced, yet comfortable and cute these are. A perfect everyday shoe. I ordered a half size up and they fit perfectly."
I love them I wear them to work everyday they are really comfortable. Love how fast I got them. They look good with whatever I wear. Really love these shoes
"I love these Sneakers, my son introduced me to these sneakers. I do recommend the sneakers."
I love this shoe. Very comfortable and true to size.
I just love how comfortable these shoes are!
Great looking pair of shoes for the wife. She loves them! Also bought at an awesome price as well.
PERFECT! Great fit...nice look.
Got these in violet for my 16 month old granddaughter in a 4t. She is closer to a 3 1/2 but these fit well. Easy to get on too.
Real cute for my 16 month old granddaughter. A little heavy for her feet. Thought the shoes were lighter in weight.
"I absolutely love the look of these shoes and wanted them to work. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing wrong, but I couldn‚Äôt get them on my foot. The ratio of the size of the shoe and my foot did not match with the size of the opening to get my foot in there. Additionally, there isn‚Äôt really any stretch around the opening very confused and sad."
"Doesn't live up to the Peg Turbo name. The scraps of Zoom X foam used is like a dense, firm, and hard version of it. They should've just named this Pegasus next nature. Those of us who ran in the previous versions of the Peg Turbo know how good a running shoe that was an this doesn't come anywhere close."
"The shoe is very comfortable.  My major complaint is the outer sole is very thin and wears fast. I am a heavy heal striker, but I wore through the  outer sole in 50 miles.  I add sheet metal screws to the corners after about 200 miles normally, so I won't buy this style again.  I've had a least 3 pairs of Pegasus every year since they came out."
"Bought these a couple of weeks ago. So comfy, with a cushioned sole, waterproof and feel like your walking on fresh air. True to size. I am a size 5.5."
The soul came undone within a WEEK. And not waterproof after a month
"These were very nice but I need more of an indoor gym sneaker, rather than an outdoor pair."
Muy comodos
Comfy and stylish
My daughter loves her shoes they are perfect for everything
"Nice, comfortable, and fit very nicely. It‚Äôs good if you just want a more athletic everyday shoe."
"Hmm, not very good quality. After the 3rd day of wearing these, the heel on left trainer started making clicking noise. I dont know how these trainers would stand up to being used for serious workouts."
These are nice supportive running shoes. My son just didn‚Äôt love the colors
"I really like the design for these shoes, but will say the material used is disappointing. It's not leather or even synthetic leather, it's some other material, and it dirties easily and does not seem to be very durable. Time will tell on the durability though. And as others have said on this site and others, these shoes are VERY difficult to get on. My 3 y.o. cannot get them on by herself at all and I really struggle to. I'm wishing I had returned them before she wore them outside. I do not recommend these."
My niece loved them! The color will match all her little outfits and she‚Äôll be the cool fast runner she always tries to be!
"My daughter loves them, easy on easy off. Very well made, good quality and nice colour choices and good fit"
Amazing fit! Love the all black color. Great for running and the daily errands. Five stars.
"I've been a big fan of the Free 5.0 for quite a few years, excluding the two models prior to this one. The forefoot is roomy, provides great ground feel and is flexible. They're very light and comfortable.  However, the chunky, elongated heel truly prevents this version from being as good as it could be. Well, for me anyway.  Also, grab a pair of quality laces, because these are sooooooo thin!  Speaking of thin, the cloth material of the heel is much too thin, and I doubt it will hold up for long.  I'm glad Nike is moving 'back' in the right direction with the 5.0 and hope they continue accordingly. If it weren't for the chunky heel and thin cloth, this shoe would be very tough to beat, IMO."
"These are my husband's absolutely favorite pair of shoes! He said it feels like he's not wearing shoes at all. He wore his first pair out (after 3 years of continuous wear) just got his second pair. Nike if you ever decide to quit making these, please let me know, and we'll stock up."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] On line shopping is easy. I like to go into the store but it‚Äôs not always convenient.
"These shoes are cute, comfortable, and stylish. I stand on my feet for 8 hours a day and they don‚Äôt hurt my feet. True to size. Great price."
Fabulous trainers for general walking and working out. Lots of compliments.
"Really pretty shoe, also comfortable. Make sure you size down at least one size. My daughter normally wears a 1.5Y and the 1Y is way too big."
"I was super excited for this to be a cute spring sneaker for my daughter. The colors appear faded/pastel in the picture but that‚Äôs not the case at all in person. The dark part is black, the laces almost look like a burnt brownish pink, and the area where it appears lilac in the picture looks like a grey-ish purple. It‚Äôs really ugly, truthfully. Returning asap."
"They are a perfect match for my outfit!!

"I have the pink running shoes and i absolutely love them! They are so cute, comfortable, and light perfect everyday shoe to workout. I throw mine in the washer with my clothes and air dry them and they will dry so quick! I would definitely purchase again!"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very comfortable and true to size. Feels like a sock.
Another amazing shoe for everyday use. Couldn‚Äôt be happier with the quality and performance.
I been wear Nike Infity React now from 2 to now react 4 ( over 10 pairs) and absolutely obsessed. I do a lot of power walking and also every day I work out and I have never had this comfortable shoe in my life. Nike react4 is different than normal sizing I usually wear a tennis shoe in size 8 this one I had to get it in 8.5. You just can‚Äôt go wrong with these. I never wore tennis shoes other than for workout but now since they make this look so good I wear them everywhere and I get multiple pairs at the time.
"Love them so much. I love running. That's why I needed this buddy to be with me. I also purchased Invincible 3, but these shoes are perfect for my feet. And they looked stylish too. I love pink. I got the pink ones for me. It motivated me to run. ^^"
Good looking and very confortable. The squeaking is extremely annoying. I want to love them but I often feel I am walking awkwardly to 'try to be quiet'.
"This pair of shoes just got delivered to my home and I tried them on immediately. I must admit that I feel like I‚Äôm walking on the clouds with these babies on. I just can‚Äôt wait to wear them at work. It‚Äôs a good thing I ordered them a half size up because they run a little on the small side. Besides that, these are one of the best for comfort."
These are the worst shoes I‚Äôve ever worn. I bought them based off the looks. After a month they have zero support and squeak. I have never had a pair of shoes squeak like this. It‚Äôs insane! Do not buy these shoes!
"Great shoe for long runs and super supportive! However, it‚Äôs a bit of a boring shoe to look at. Please make them in more exciting colourways."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these for my junior in high school. He loves them and they look great.
"I must have bought easily more that 20 pairs of structures over the years (usually 2-4 pairs annually). This version I am disappointed in. Still same foot support but two big differences from my earlier versions - the tongue is different and I‚Äôve not quite figured out what - it seems flimsier, not as big, not as cushioning. And the shoe laces are terrible - double knotted and they still come undone within about 1 km of walking. I‚Äôve even triple knotted them and they last longer but still eventually come undone. Surely this is something that would easily be found in the lab???"
I have worn the Nike trainers for many years and I am still as pleased with them now
"Love the style of these shoes, but they are too stiff for me to walk in. They also run narrow. Unfortunately I have to return them :("
"I don't usually buy this style but to my surprise they are very comfortable and not tight, happy with my purchase"
"My favorite trainers ever please do not discontinue these ever. I have already bought another pair for back up
I will continue to use these trainers for the rest of my life please keep them forever. And please continue selling them"
They're very comfortable and I love them
"Nice Quality, pair looks very nice for price paid. Definitely worth the purchase"
"I've already purchased this shoe 1 time and am purchasing a second pair a week later. The style caught my eye first off. 
I had seriously injured my leg 2 months ago and my physical therapist suggested I buy Asics, which I did. I've ALWAYS been a Nike fan though but she said the soles weren't stiff enough. ""One"" of the multiple injuries was a badly broken toe which can't be fixed bc its too late. It will take a year to heal, I'm told. In the meantime, every shoe I've worn, causes pain...until these!!! I'm SO happy. They literally support EVERYTHING - from the ankle to the arches (which I don't really need) to the toes. These are the best shoes I've had in ages! They actually got dirty and I threw them in the wash (""quick wash"" cycle) and they came out like brand new. I dried them out in the sun - DONT machine dry them! LOVE these shoes!"
These shoes are so comfortable.  When running they seem weightless and the shoe takes all impact. I love them.
I just don‚Äôt understand the QR code on the shoe. Can‚Äôt decide if I like it or hate it.
"I can feel the recycled content it seems like. The top part of the shoe feels cheap and kinda uncomfortable at times because it's kinda tight. Shoe is"" true to size"", just tight around the toe area. The squeak some people mention is noticeable a bit but not too much. I wear them casually instead of hooping but would recommend another shoe if hooping blessed off how they feel with casual use."
"I was a bit nervous about buying unisex sneakers, as I wasn't completely sure of my size. I ordered 1/2 down from where I thought based on reviews. 
All I can says is...WOW! These are like wrapping your foot in a cloud. I have plantar fasciitis, and the arch support and heel cushioning in these is soothing yet supportive. 
I can't speak to their durability yet as I just got them, but I'm thrilled with how they feel so far!"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The most comfortable pair of Jordans I own well worth wearing

"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these almost a month ago, and put them on one, and they looked awful."
Shoe does not run true to size it runs small. True 8.5 need a size 9.
I would give these sneakers zero stars if it allowed that. I've had these shoes for 2 weeks and they already look and feel like I need a new pair. I always buy nike shoes especially to work out in and this is the first time I'm extremely disappointed.
Comfortable but my son has had them for 12 days and they already have a hole in the mesh.
"Nice looking scetchers, comfortable and lasted a long time."
My son says these are very comfortable.
"Fit is as good as the 8s, which were the best fitting metcons that I‚Äôve had.  Price was great on this color and was why I"
Good materials. Ran a little big
Improved over my Metcon 7‚Äôs. Better for short runs. But toe box is much roomier-may want to order half size smaller. Shoes also feel a little hot during tough workouts.
"This shoes is very comfortable and easy to slip on ! The best shoes to just put on and wear sweet look too , Styling and Profiling in these bad boy‚Äôs  is a must!"
Another amazing shoe for everyday use. Couldn‚Äôt be happier with the quality and performance.

First game with the new cleats and my son notched his first goal and assist of the season. I'm sure your results will vary but it's a great start with the Phantom GX II Pros.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I‚Äôve worn for practice and feels great. Easy to break in.
Look amazing and okay grip on the outside. Downside is its near impossible to get your feet into the boots as the boots design means the hole for your feet to enter the boot is quite narrow. Wouldn't recommend for wide feet players.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] 10 year old says they fit fine which only means he doesn‚Äôt hate how they look and probably has nothing to do with fit/feel.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So far so good! My daughter plays a lot so I hope they last all season.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very comfortable for my son. Cleats are a little narrow but my son has wide feet. So I sized up.
"My second pair of these!....I find them very liberating to run in, very flexible and bendy sole and soft stretchy ultra-comfortable upper. Unstructured just how I like it. I go down half a size in these as I run in them without socks, this gives me a great connected and responsive feel from my runs. Like I say quite liberating running in these, especially when sockless. Worth a try, you might like it YOLO :)"
"I had a previous generation of the free rn and loved it, and they lasted for years. These improve on the few flaws of that design (better tongue, and tread that doesn't get rocks stuck in it), while keeping the same comfort and feel."
Wow - For the absolute longest time I have been waiting for Nike to unleash the free fly knits to a more versatile performance shoe and it has arrived!  Granted for running my all-time favorite Nike shoe for running is the Nike ZoomX Invincible Run Flyknits because of the bounce and cushion support on impact but this has that support on impact and feels so comfortable compared to other running shoes.  What is amazing about this shoe is it can transition from working out indoors in a gym and running on a treadmill to taking it outdoors and running on the road.  All with the comfort and breathability of free fly knits and have been waiting for this shoe for a while.
"Great traction and feel. Have held up nicely, no signs of wear after 3 months."
I like the shoe. The run about 1/2 size smaller.
Get a 11 if u wear 10.5 Comfortable. Great quality. Hella nice
"The shoe is light, it fits well, although, it is slightly narrow, so I would suggest getting either half or a full size up, but if you don't then I suppose you could break into the shoe over time. The shoe looks great, it has good grip, and due to material on the sole, I wouldn't really suggest playing on outdoor courts. I would recommend these shoes if you plan on buying them."
"A nice new look, with different colors and grips great on the hardwood floor. I bought the neon green one three months ago as a gift for myself. But get it in a half or full size over. It's pretty tight and narrow on the sides. Other than that it's a decent shoe."
Very narrow shoe so if you double sock when you hoop this ain't the shoe for u
Not made very well
My granddaughter is very happy with then
Bought these because I needed a good supportive shoe for all the walking I do. These have been a great investment for supporting my feet. I have heal pain on and off and these have really helped so much.

Good materials. Ran a little big

"Son loves for soccer, very nice looking too"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these for my 13yo competitive soccer player. He said they have a good feel and are comfortable.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this a month ago and I am so happy with the purchase. My son says they are lightweight comfortable and a great fit for him while he plays soccer.
Dawg of a shoe. Treads lack a bit but it‚Äôs amazing and very comfy.
Had a few pairs of these. Very comfortable and great for running.
Good value and very comfortable
"The trainers were bought for my grandson (thank goodness my feet are not size 14 !). A good choice of that size were on offer unlike other sites, so I know where to look first next time. Purchase was smooth as was delivery. Thank you."
Very cute but the shoes run a size too small. Not super flexible or cushiony but daughter says they‚Äôre comfy. She loves them and they‚Äôre easy to get on and off by herself.
Only problem I have is where they put the seam for the pink stripes. They come together in the front of the shoe and they sewed it. It doesn‚Äôt look the best and I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs going to come undone. Expect more from a Jordan product.
I absolutely LOVE these sneakers! They feel like you‚Äôre walking on a cloud. The layer of cushion is so comfortable. I have planter fasciitis and these sneakers help me so much! Do yourself a favor and buy them!
Love these lightweight super comfortable shoes. I got these in white with blue and pink accents. So cute. I get complements on them all the time
Very comfortable shoes
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These shoes are pretty comfortable thanks to their air bubble. I like the retro look as well. For me, these run big, so I went with a 12 where I would ordinarily wear a 13 in Air Maxes"
Not as expected. I was very disappointed to see the quality was not up to the Nike standards that I expected. They crease near the toe when walking in them. The tongue area is very snug because it‚Äôs seen with elastic on each side. The fit is different than my other air max styles and the materials are a bit lighter weight and not very durable. The cushion at the bottom has a hard spongy feeling. Not impressed!
Probably the most comfortable trainers I‚Äôve ever had. Looks amazing in white. Love them.
This Shoes are very Contible to walk and run specially for Gym I like this Nike Flex Shoes I buy 2 pairs because I like them.
I use them for walking around and running and jogging and going out showing them off for people to see. I think they are very comfortable and add a little spring to my step
"Very comfortable shoes, but the worst shoelaces I have ever had on a pair of shoes. They never stay tied, even though I have to double tied them."
Very comfortable right out of the box. Fit true to size. The colors look much better in person. Bought the all night and the hyper blue. Waiting for the all day color to become available and will buy as soon as it does. Hope I don't have to wait too long!
Most comfortable pair of shoes i‚Äôve ever worn. I‚Äôm flat footed and  these are best shoes I‚Äôve ever had for that issue honestly can‚Äôt even tell when my foot touches the ground it‚Äôs like walking on a cloud.
"I‚Äôm flat footed, I was hesitant about buying these. Glad I did, very comfortable shoes. Will buy other pairs."
"I had the Metcon 4 and they lasted 5 years and saw these and thought it‚Äôs time. OMG they are so amazing I do cross fit style workouts and I felt so solid and such a great base foundation under me. Such an incredible difference. More stiff than the 4‚Äôs and I was worried they might cause chaffing on my ankle, but they didn‚Äôt. Day 1 and I‚Äôm a Metcon for life gal!"
I love these shoes! They‚Äôre super comfortable and really unique looking. They will look cute this summer with shorts or even a sun dress.
Very comfortable. Wide toe box. True to size. Great colour & great price. Perfect shoes for weight lifting.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought for son. He liked the fit and color. No complaints on the fit after a few practices and games.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These cleats fit and feel great so far on the field, both grass and turf."
"I am a division 1 women's soccer player, and I only wear my tiempos. I have had no issues. They mold to your feet and are very comfortable once broken in. Couldn't recommend more!"
"Not good, I don't like it.picture and shoes look different to me."
"I use these as my everyday shoes, very comfortable and quality Nikes"
Grandson was delighted with them and they arrived promptly.
"AMAZING,my daughter loves these shoes she says‚Äùthey are the most comfortable shoe that I have ever owned‚Äù , if we go on any trips I don‚Äôt even get a chance to ask her to pack her shoes anymore because I know that she will easily choose these shoes."
I have arthritis and get pain in the bottom of my feet a lot. I couldn‚Äôt run 5 minutes without being in pain. I started wearing these a got to 20 minutes. Bouncy shoe and good support
"My son was so excited to get these shoes! He loves that he can use them for all sports. They are very versatile and as a parent I love the ease of these shoes. They are very comfy and the insoles have such a nice plush to them. I‚Äôm amazed at how light these shoes are but still provide full support. My son said they make him run even faster. He said, ‚Äúthey go with his style and are very cool‚Äù. I would recommend these for any parent looking for a great all-around shoe and for any kid looking for something fast and cool."
"The Air Max DN is an awesome sneaker with a very stylish look. I presented my young daughter with a pair and she fell in love with them immediately. It has just enough color to make it pop but doesn‚Äôt make the shoe too noisy. 

The shoe fits like a glove and runs true to size. The material is breathable but doesn‚Äôt get too dirty and cleans easy. It‚Äôs a perfect shoe for a kid who lives an active lifestyle but comfortable enough to wear daily. My daughter wears them everyday as well as to gym class, with no issues. As a parent, I would recommend the Air Max DN to anyone for either themselves or their kids."
"They are very comfortable and I love the colorway as well. The only downside for me is the sizing but I have wide feet so this always happens to me. I should‚Äôve sized down but other than that, I love the shoes:)"
S√∫per comfortable and cool to wear it with any clothes.
"Where have these been all my life? I almost cried when I put them on. I got in white, true to size. They have a HOKA Bondi 8 vibe but BETTER, CUTER, I will recommend to anyone. I'm converted! PS I just use these for walking, not running."
Very lightweight and comfortable
"Pretty comfy, but after a few hours of wearing them they squeak terribly!! It‚Äôs quite embarrassing and puts me off wearing them for work! I can safely say I have never had squeaky trainers before :-("
Great runners and good value do comforysble
My daily runners! Love them but I would recommend sizing up 1/2 size to add cushion as the back rubs. One con-Sometimes I get a popping sound but other than that it is an excellent sneaker!
"Very comfy shoe. Love the wide fit. Wore for a whole day of walking, and never got any leg cramps. Good traction and sturdy on grass. Breathable, durable and fit true to size."
Absolutely love these runners. Excellent cushioning and very comfy. Wide and not cramped. True to size. Wore them all day walking & no leg cramps. The heel is wide to keep me from falling backwards which is great. Good grip on the floor and very sturdy on the grass. I highly recommend.
"Love the shoes for golfing
They are fun colors and pretty comfortable
 They actually say wide so i went a half size smaller since that was my only option but they definitely are not wide & i am going to make do!"
Fits great for wide.  Some Nike golf shoes run small but this is true to size. Like how they are flat and not elevated and they feel just like my Nike free workout shoes.
Love these!! The entire show opens up via  Velcro to make them easy on AND easy off.
"My son loves them, they are very comfortable and easy to put on. I got two pairs with different sizes, and I am planning to get them for my toddler boy too."
These are perfect for my 5 year old. She has to wear tennis shoes for PE twice a week and these are so easy to put on without the look of typical Velcro shoes.
"Nice shoes but WAY too narrow. Also the ""sock"" isn't very stretchy, so they are very difficult to get on.
Overall, these run small."
"They are the best shoes we have bought, good quality, the best, they are not heavy, they are comfortable"
"These are the best and most great-looking cleats. At first, the shoes are incredibly tight, but after two games of breaking them in, they are ready to be used at every game without any issues and they look awesome."
I love them but I haven't worn them yet I'm just a sneakerhead that loves to buy a bunch of shoes and have them for whenever I'm ready to wear them. LOL
On time and love the product thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
Excellent shoe
Size up by at least a full size or more. These run very small. I had my 9-yr old‚Äôs foot measured in store as a size 1 before I ordered. Got a 1 and 1.5 - and the 1.5 was way too small.
Not true to size need to return
The strap that goes across the top is way too small. Every time we have to try pulling so hard to get it to stick to the velcro and then the minute my son starts walking or running it comes undone. Seems so odd that they wouldn‚Äôt have make it a little bit longer

They arrived on time and the shoes are great. My kid loves them.
Great price for soccer cleats. My son can be very picky about his shoes and how they fit. He likes these very much and they seem to fit very well.

"I love the fit but the shoes are clunky/stiff
Normally wear 12 had to get 12.5"
"Ordered on Sunday evening and received Wednesday afternoon. Shoes were what we expected. Great service! I have twins with size 15 feet, we order all their shoes from here and are always happy with the selection and speedy delivery!"
It tore on the stitches on my third wear. I bought a new pair because it was comfortable and nice looking though.
"Great shoe. Fit well, sized up half, comfortable"
"I had the Dow shifter 11 and really like the way it felt, perfect for an everyday shoe."
Comfortable for 12 hour shifts on your feet.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These shoes are cute, durable, easy to put on, and comfortable. My toddler typically won‚Äôt keep shoes on, but loves these."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Academy is by far the most easiest store I have dealt with. Whether it's making a purchase or a return.
They are good for a toddler learning to walk
It‚Äôs one of the most comfortable shoe I have. I bought 3 pairs. I use one for running and the other two for work.
"Honestly, the reinforced midsole support on the top of the shoe kind of hurts as it rubs against my foot. The Downshifter 12, which was softer, was a better feel. The cushion is insanely comfortable, though!"
Son loves them
We love them we are going to get them customized. They are big so we are going to downsize to a 12.5.. We thought because he was in 13c shoes he would be the same size in cleats but I guest not.
Not comfortable for cuts and foot plants.

I‚Äôm glad I got this . It‚Äôs unique but doesn‚Äôt seek to be so good on a sloppy surface .
"Glad I bought it! So comfortable and gives me a bit of height 
Just hoping it won‚Äôt get dirty too easily"
My daughter loves these shoes for volleyball. She says they are like walking on clouds. We got her tts 8.5 and they fit perfect!
"These Run small forsure, I‚Äôm a size 10M regularly but in these an 11m fits perfectly.
Very comfortable for the gym!"
I have two pairs of these and I love them. I got a full size up and they fit just right. I would recommend going one full size up.
Great shoe! If you wear size 10 men Nike cleats I‚Äôd go size 10.5 on this.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My 9 year old was ready for new cleats. She tried on about 8 different pair and kept coming back to these ones. She loves them and there wasn't a breaking in period. They were comfortable from day 1.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My dayghter loves the comfort of these cleats. They don‚Äôt slip when she runs.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought my nephew his cleats for youth football, he believes they make him super fast. Thank you FICKS for always having the latest in sports equipment"
"Looks sharp on the foot! Fits good, probably runs 1/4-1/2 size big so pretty close. The sole & back are great, The main issue with this sneaker is there is no support on the side of the sneaker because it‚Äôs all soft mesh. So you really need to make sure you lace up tight. Definitely won‚Äôt be playing pickle ball or any sports in them except walking."
They are great like the way the feel on my feet
Nike has done it again! The orange is my favorite color and the fit is superb!
Very comfortable shoes.  Wear them all day at work.  On my feet and so comfy.
"Love Love Love My Nike Air Max 90. Most sneakers don‚Äôt look right on my feet, but these look perfect. I wear a size 9, which is what I purchased, and they fit perfectly. I bought the black and thinking about ordering more colors."
"By far my favorite style of Air Max. I also have the white, gray and teal version but had a really hard time keeping them clean with weekends spent at the ballfields!"
"The shoes look great and my son said they are comfortable. However, durability is terrible. I bought them at beginning of March and my middle of April the velcro has started fallen apart, and the threads are coming out, making the shoes look like they have been worn for ages. $60 for a pair of shoes that barely last 2 months is ridiculous!"
Huge hole in front after a month of moderate wear. Really disappointed.
Great shoes! Love the quality and great styling.
My son loves his shoes and I‚Äôm glad I don‚Äôt have to tie his shoes anymore
Perfect fit
"I bought a pair for my 17 month old son and they are perfect. easy to put on, wide to accommodate his feet. He walks so easily in them. They also are affordable bc toddlers feet grow so fast. I highly recommend them."
A little narrow but overall great performance
I have 4 pairs of Nike 8.5 wide sneakers and they all fit perfectly. This was supposed to be an 8.5 Wide and it is narrow and a half an inch smaller. It's labeled 8.5 Wide but I think it's actually an 8 regular. It is a shame because it is such a great looking shoe. The sizing is just off. I ordered it online and now I will be returning it soon.
This is the third pair of these my daughter has used for indoor. She prefers the fit of these to the laced boots. She averages about 7-8 hours a week in these throughout the winter. Quality is excellent and we've never had a pair fail. Will definitely buy again.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My son chose these for indoor soccer, worked out great. Buy also flat enough where he loves wearing them to school lol"
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Money well spent.
 Shoes fit perfect on my son no complains at all"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My son has a hard time finding cleats that aren‚Äôt too tight and width-wise and these have been comfortable for him. They have also held up well.
Came within three days of ordering. With other boots there quite hard to break in but with these they took a little bit of wearing without playing then I headed straight into training and they fit perfectly. I was quite concerned about the colour because of how light it is but there easy to clean. The grip provided on Astro with them was great and same with other grounds I tested them on soft ground and there better than I expected as these boots are mg and I was on sg
Nice and lightweight takes a while to break in tho
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these for my daughter and she loves how comfortable and light weight they are. They also are great for going between turf and grass fields
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these for my daughter‚Äôs spring season. She had only had a couple practices in them. But so far, so good. She loves that there is no laces and she can slip right on."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Son loves these. These are his first pair of non laced boots so we will see how they hold up. But they seem snug and comfortable. The white stands out.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My daughter loves these! Fits great, comfortable and durable. I would recommend these to anyone!"
Love the fit and look! My daughter loves how supportive this shoe is. She has narrow feet and Nike has consistently been our go to shoe for comfort.
"Excellent, light weight, and good looking shoe"
Great buy. Greatly recommended. Must have in your collection
"They‚Äôre comfortable but way to true to size , im a 9 and they‚Äôre tight since they get narrower to the toes."
"Honestly these are great ! They feel amazing , I have 9s in FG and decided to pick these up for Turf. For me they fit just like 9s , I‚Äôm true to size 10.5 and I have wide feet ! These are very low profile , and this is why I picked these over other models !"
"These are so comfortable! I use them on a tread & you can definitely feel the heel support. 
Would love to see these in more color options."
So far so good with these. The cushioning is very nice and makes the shoes super comfy!
These were probably the best shoe that I have ever got For my mom
These are great!!!
I mainly use these shoes for work which is very comfortable and also breathable
Very comfortable sneakers!
"I liked it. it looks really good. its just that it was a little too tight. I will have it exchanged for a 9.5 instead of 9. my other nike shoes that are size 9 and fit me perfectly, so the sizing is just a little off."
"my last Air Force 1s were a size 3 and they fit perfectly, so i ordered a 3 again and these white + blue ones were toooo long, despite being the same size as my previous pair. colour is lush tho"
"Love these new trainers, they are comfortable and very stylish"

"The slide is just big.
Usually I wear an 11 but this fits like a size 13. Can‚Äôt even enjoy them so they sit on the shelf."
The Most Comfortable Nike Slides I ever purchased I'm definitely going to order another pair
"Big & clunky looking.  Not what I expected. Instead of a circular and flat sole, it is a thick square shape on the outside with a big clunky wedge. I am usually a 8 1/2 so I got a 9. Looks more like a 10. The things that I like is the tan color, the straps, and the fact that they are made out of recycled material."
Product looks good but fits small. I had to order 3 times to finally arrive at a size that fits. I wear 9.5 but had to settle on 10.5
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My son needed a new pair of boots for rugby and soccer cleats work great, especially when you are a goal kicker. My son has wider feet and these Nikes work great for him. In fact, he made his first conversion kick this past weekend! And of course, we always love shopping at Dicks."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Fits great. Excellent grip both on grass and on artificial turf
I got the navy blue and white ones. I'm not going to lie. It took a good 3 days to break in to where they feel comfortable. I get compliments all the time on my shoes. Nice purchase.
"I have worn them 3 times so far and they took a few times to break in since they were a little stiff. Now they are great, the insoles are really comfortable and the grip around the ankles is perfect. I use them especially for work and I am on my feet and walking for about 7 hours of my shift. Basketball sneakers always keep me going without discomfort. I find them to be essential and are some of the best recent sneakers I have purchased. These are definitely a recommend. They fit perfectly."
"The shoes are very pretty but quite heavy with minimal cushion, this is after one wear tho, hopefully the mold to feet after breaking in"
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought these turf shoes after recommended by a friend, thankfully my son loves them! They‚Äôre built sturdy, while still being lightweight enough for him to be agile on the baseball field."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is actually the 2nd pair we have purchased. When my son outgrew them he asked for another pair! He says they are lightweight and comfortable and have held up well each time.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these for my son for baseball tournaments. He likes them a lot, says they are very comfortable."
I bought these for my son and they broke within a week.
Great color perfect fit
"They shoes fit perfectly my son is a runner so this shoe was the perfect fit for him . 
Easy to clean and wipe after a long day of playing outside for my son"
"Arguably the most comfortable running shoe I've worn. I picked these up after my Pegasus 39's starting wearing thin and they're a huge upgrade over the Pegasus platform. Roomy in the toe box, light, and they look pretty great as well. I wear an 11 but always go up a 1/2 size with Nike. Great shoes!"
They looked and felt great. They did run a little small so I returned them and ordered a half size larger than what I typically am.  I will have to report back after I put some miles on them.
Great shoe. Extremely comfortable and not narrow like the Pegasus line. Shoe has ton of cushion and has a great feel when running
Runs big. I could of got away with a half a size smaller.
My wife is really happy with her shoes. They look great and feel great.
"Bought the shoes for my daughter. She has a large and wide foot. She just loves them. They are so comfortable,she says! I bought the revolution myself in the past and I‚Äôd liked the üëü"
My son loves these shoes so far. Works great on turf for his winter catching camp.  We did have to go a half size up.
"Absolutely awesome. So comfy, lightweight too"
"So far all I did was try them on. Footbed is comfortable. Overall shoe feels snug. The only thing of concern is the top of the toes, a pressure point feel when walking. The bend of the shoe pushes down on top of your foot and toes crease. I will give them a try during a workout session in the gym. If they break in I will follow up with a second review. True to size as well."
"What a great shoe. This is obviously based on the Victory Tour 3 to my eyes. Has the same DNA but just different enough be distinct and is a joy to wear. You get more cushion on the inside with a little more flex with the out soles. I like the styling and how the swoosh is presented with these shoes. My first round wearing these was great, a very comfortable shoe with a lot of support. I wish I could comment on the water proofing but I live in a dry climate with not a lot of rain, but they seem to be made of materials that will not let moisture get in, I fondly call these the feisty little brother to the Victory Tour 3. I usually wear 11.5 but these are 12.5 and fit well. Caution when ordering."
Just got these delivered and they look great. I wanted an athletic golf shoe with traction for all weather. These fit the bill better than any other Nike golf shoe out right now. Unfortunately they run a little small and had to exchange for a half size larger.
"Stylish , and good price for this product . Ordered 1/2 up as Nike's tend to run a bit smaller in size"
Fast easy to use great prices! I will definitely shop here again.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We bought these for our little one to play coach pitch softball. They are great quality, very comfortable and she loves them!"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Our daughter loves the style and fit of her new softball cleats.
"Outstanding tennis shoe, sleek and comfortable...classic looking, light feeling.. can wear them around the house...workout in them, or wear them as dress attire..happiest nikes Ive ever ownned"
"Got these for my 14 years old and he loved them. They run very small, he is usually a 6.5 and got him 8.5. Nike usually runs small. Shoe is classic black with a modern flare"
"Amazing shoes, very light and comfortable !!"
Bought these for my 7 year old grandson for summer. great trainers and the colours go with everything. Fast delivery and a great price
"I bought it for my son,it so nice with high quality."
My sons favorite shoes! Says they are comfortable and he loves the style!
"Great shoe for long runs and super supportive! However, it‚Äôs a bit of a boring shoe to look at. Please make them in more exciting colourways."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these for my junior in high school. He loves them and they look great.
"I must have bought easily more that 20 pairs of structures over the years (usually 2-4 pairs annually). This version I am disappointed in. Still same foot support but two big differences from my earlier versions - the tongue is different and I‚Äôve not quite figured out what - it seems flimsier, not as big, not as cushioning. And the shoe laces are terrible - double knotted and they still come undone within about 1 km of walking. I‚Äôve even triple knotted them and they last longer but still eventually come undone. Surely this is something that would easily be found in the lab???"
"Very happy with purchase, my niece loves them, very comfortable, it‚Äôs hard to get them off her, wants them on all the time!"
My toddler grandson loves these shoes! They are stylish and comfortable.
Great shoe
My daily runners! Love them but I would recommend sizing up 1/2 size to add cushion as the back rubs. One con-Sometimes I get a popping sound but other than that it is an excellent sneaker!
"Very comfy shoe. Love the wide fit. Wore for a whole day of walking, and never got any leg cramps. Good traction and sturdy on grass. Breathable, durable and fit true to size."
Absolutely love these runners. Excellent cushioning and very comfy. Wide and not cramped. True to size. Wore them all day walking & no leg cramps. The heel is wide to keep me from falling backwards which is great. Good grip on the floor and very sturdy on the grass. I highly recommend.
Happy with product and delivery service
I'm going to wear the sneakers for fashion. I love how the sneakers are so soft and comfortable. They're easy to put on and they're cute.
I bought these Air Max trainers recently as a birthday gift for my 10 year old grandson He is delighted with them.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My daughter picked these out for soccer. They match whatever uniform she has. She did size up 1 size from her normal tennis shoe size (probably feels more comfortable due to thicker socks). So far they have held up great!
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These shoes fit great. Our daughter says they are very comfortable.
"I purchased these cleats for my upcoming Sunday League, and they did not disappoint! They were comfortable all around and was very high quality. The material is incredibly soft, and it feels very well cushioned! They are perfect for people playing casual soccer or just beginning their soccer journey!"
"It is now the ideal size, and I appreciate your careful handling during shipping. I am thankful for your efforts."
The most comfortable Nikes I‚Äôve owned and I have a lot! They are like walking on air and they don‚Äôt feel too bulky. Love them
"Beautiful, Comfortable, Stylish..True to size. Love it."
My son loves these shoes. Says they're very comfortable
Purchased these for my 10 year old. He said they are very comfortable upon his first few wears.
Looks like a great fit for an aspiring golfer. Wants to wear them in the house but parents won't let him.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought for my son, extremely happy, comfortable, quality cleat for the price."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My 13 year old loves these cleats so far, we're halfway into the season. Not having to worry about shoe strings while on the field is game changing. 
They fit well in length, a smidge narrow for his wide foot but it loosened up some after a few days on the field."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love these cleats, especially the ghost laces! Great for turf or field."

"These are super comfortable! I have many cleats and these check so many boxes. They mold nicely to my feet, offer structured support, are soft, have a nice pad touch to the ball, material is well made, and they look and feel beautiful. Lastly, for the price these are unbeatable. Highly recommend these!"
"Light weight, comfortable, good mobility. Exactly what I was looking for"
"So far so good. Nicer shoe than expected for my 15 year old son. He wears an 11 mens. Lighter than typical leather cleats. The tongue can be cut off if they don't like it. He has not done that yet, but may after more wears. Only worn so far on turf."
I wanted a nice first pair of sneakers for my 1 year old daughter. Couldnt decide on Jordans or Air max 1's? Love both but i decided to go with these Air Max 1 Ice cream.These particular shoes are very cute and comfortable for little girls. The color scheme is very nice!
Cute shoes runs kind of small. Got to get them in a bigger size but all in all a good light shoe.
Great shoes. Easy on is the best idea for kids.

Good fit. Finally a turf shoe with the position of a defender in mind.
My son LOVES these shoes!! He‚Äôs actually worn them as turf shoes for baseball and as golf shoes as well. They fit great and look cool too.
"My son loves them.. the color, the feel and the look"
My wife loves the blue color and the shoe is like walking on a cloud.  Very comfortable.
"Love them 
Highly recommend
For everyday wear"
"I ordered these shoes for workout purposes. And it's a really good shoe with a snug but comfortable fit and a very stable sole. And most importantly, I really love this color. It looks luxurious. I love it very much!"
"Awesome price, but too small for the child they were bought for"
"My baby girl loves these shoes. They are so easy to take on and off but not for her‚Ä¶ which is a bonus. They have a side Velcro
Opening which makes it easy to put on my baby girl. These are one of the first pairs of shoes that she does not take them off and they do not fall off. Super quality."
good schools

very comfy nice material and great value for this price
Great fit and very great cushioning great for speed and protection
Loved these! My son was able to customize them and put his name on them. He has loved playing indoor soccer with them!! Actually I have to stop him from wearing them everywhere else!
Great shoe my 8yr old loves the fit and style and will use it for futsol
My son loves these shoes. They are light weight and wide enough for his toes. He has the same cleats so it‚Äôs nice keeping the similar line of shoe.
Very sharp. These shoes are great.
"Super comfy, great support and super light, great grip on the turf, great toe protection, I actually find them more comfortable than my trout turfs and my hurache turfs"
"The shoe looks nice, but is very narrow at the toe. I would definitely go up a half size for sure."

"True to size, very light , good colours for boys.
My son loved them"
Very comfortable for walking and running using them for school
Great size and fit
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought these for my kid for track. They fit and they‚Äôre comfortable.
very cumfterbol light weight look nice werth the price
"I use these for long distance walking and running. They are very comfortable and fit as described. I‚Äôm normally a size 3 in shoes but with Nike I‚Äôm a 3.5/ 4. I went with a 4 (23.5cm) and they fit nice and comfortable. And considering I run with them, it leaves me enough space for when my feet swell. Very lightweight and good quality."
Both my older boys are on the High School Football team and said these fit great and durable. Not bad for the price as well.
It was a gift for my grandson.
Runs narrow and not available in wide widths
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these for my daughter and she loves them. Says their comfortable and stylish. The price is very reasonable as well.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great product I would recommend these for softball.

"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] bought for my grandson
he really likes them and says they are very comfortable"
I bought this and in 3 days it arrived when it arrived it came well packaged and the shoes feel great there nice comfortable and good looking
"This product itself is great - comfortable to wear, fits well and very light weight. However I have a big complaint about the sizing. I have been wearing size 10 all my life but when it comes to Tiempo Legend 10 it is no longer consistent. I bought a pair of Legend 10 Pro TF it needed to be adjusted to 10.5. I bought this Legend 10 Academy MG it needed to be adjusted to 11. For me, I had to repeat purchase/return cycle multiple times. For Nike, they got higher return rate which is not good for the business. Really hope Nike can take action to make sizing consistent."
"Love this shoe. It has incredible arch and ankle support. I never knew how badly I needed these shoes until I put them on my feet. My foot feels like it‚Äôs being hugged by the love child of a cloud and memory foam mattress. Since there is a good amount of padding and cushion, I recommend sizing up half a size. I did that and they fit perfectly. RUN, don‚Äôt walk, to buy these shoes."
They should make these for men. They fit great but there was like no cushion in the footbed.
very comfortable. wears like a moc. always get compliments from strangers when I wear it out. if looking for a looser fit would half size up
"These are super cute. I want them in Brown, Black, Gray all colors. So comfy, stylish."

Fits to size comfortable great colors lightweight
"The shoes are lightweight and comfortable, and I like the look off all black. The service was very good as the package arrived in just a couple of days."
"Love them, brilliant pair of boots! Use them when playing football with my mates on the weekends and Rugby in the week, plenty of grip on AG and Grass Pitches!"
These cleats have worked well for my narrow-footed kiddo. No heel slippage.
"He said the studs grip so well. They fit nicely too

We know Nike come up small so always get the next size up as his feet are wide so for us, the fit is spot on"
Not right size extremely wide
My favorite toddler shoes! They are great for wide feet and the Velcro straps allow you to open the shoe wide enough to easily take on or off. Very comfy shoes for new walkers/toddlers. They hold up well and can be washed in the washing machine! Love them!
"Extremely comfy and breathable! Definitely order at least 1/2 size down. I normally wear a 7 in 270s (but I sometimes get 7.5s for summer bc my feet swell). I ordered 6.5s based on reviews online, and they were still way big. I exchanged them for 6s, and they still have plenty of room. 

I got the bright green ones, and I get tons of compliments!"
Very comfortable and stylish. Love the bright vibrant colors.
Not fit to size. Run small
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Good price. Run a little small but I always expect that. Easy to clean.
Great boots. Definitely small made though. I am normally a 4 and needed 5s. Great quality and the stud lay out has definitely boosted the confidence I have after returning from knee injuries
"I really wanted to love this shoe. I typically wear a women's 10 or a men's 8.5 and I ordered a half size up (men's 9) because I knew the Tanjun didn't have a lot of arch support or cushioning, so there would be plenty of space for me to swap in my own orthotic insoles. But right out of the box it feels small, and since the sockliner is glued down, if I do add insoles I'll have to put them on top of it, which might mean having to go up another full size. I ordered them because of the hands free slip-on feature, and that seems to work well, but I haven't made up my mind whether to try a bigger size or just send them back. I'm so disappointed. But my needs are not universal. If you don't need additional arch support or cushioning, and if you can get the size right, then this could be a great shoe for you. I will say that the green color is a little brighter and more attractive in person than it was online, so there's that."
"Go up a size. I wear a 12 normally but had to get 13 and even then I can see my toe outline. Hope that doesn‚Äôt bother me after a while.
I‚Äôve been looking for a shoe that you can step into and run out of the house quickly. These are comfortable for what I need them for.. errands mainly.
I can‚Äôt see them replacing my gym shoes.  They are just not those type of shoes."

"Shoes are amazing, fly knit makes it super comfortable for all feet shapes and sizes. Made from material that allows you to really feel the ball...I have tried many boots over the years, simply by far the best"
"I just tried two sizes 9.5 was way too tight, and 10, though fitting better, was too long. The quality feels cheap compared to other pro-TFs I've had in the past. I miss the leather tiempos."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] They did a good job with the gx2. Solid feeling when striking
Really comfy and look pretty good
great comfort looks stylish got them for my husband and he loves them
High quality slides but runs small. Wish half sizes her available. I usually wear a size 9/9.5. Ordered a 9 and had to size up to 10 but still a little small. I wish half sizes were available because I could have gone up another half size.
These are not non tie ! Tried everything and can‚Äôt work it out
"First and foremost, these cleats are adorable! I had only ever seen them in adult sizes, but these small, child sized ones are so cute. 

The shoes are very light-weight and easy to put on. A little more ankle support would be nice, so maybe add a mid or high-top option? 

Very comfortable and sturdy shoe."
My son loves these cleats. They fit great and are comfortable. Look super cool too!
Came just as ordered and a day early!!
Really cute made nice and thick padding but ru. Really narrow and tight. Never experienced this with Nike before It might be the thicker padding. So size up with hopes of it giving more space.
No reviews available
"I love these shoes.  They are SO comfortable, almost like walking on your bare feet!!  The style is so unique, it's what people notice first about them, then they notice the cool color!  I would recommend them for sure.   While they are super comfortable and cool, a little more care could have been taken with the trimming of the rubber around the edge of the upper and the sole which makes them look a little inferior and not really worth the recommended price point. But when you're ordering online there is no way of really being able to see such intricacies. Otherwise, it's a really cool shoe!!"
Love these sneaker they help me with my foot spurs pain without insoles. I was looking at the size and research if I should get a bigger or smaller usually been getting 8.5 the last Nikes but I got this one a 8 and it fits perfectly. I mostly walk a lot and go to the gym this really works for me.
Bought these two years ago and they are still holding strong. Finally about to upgrade to a new pair. They are the most comfortable shoe I‚Äôve ever worn and I get so many compliments on them. It feels like I‚Äôm wearing no shoes. Highly recommend
"These cleats are really good quality and they will give you a good performance when playing soccer, they are really good for playing in artificial grass and also natural and they adapt really well to different terrains, they fit in really well and you can adjust them how you want too."
My son wears them every day to school and to practice
Good shoe no complaints. Fits true to size my son enjoys them.
My son loves these football shoes. He‚Äôs a size 5 and they fit perfectly (so size is true to fit). They‚Äôre comfortable and offer good grip on grass. He‚Äôs also used them on hard court surfaces. The colour way is really stylish: subtle with some nice detailing. The use of materials and colours means that they clean easily too which is a big plus for parents! Overall these are an excellent pair of football shoes and I‚Äôd highly recommend them.
These were great and then BOOM!!! They were squeaky af. Stay away from these at all costs.
was nice until they become super squeaky. like toddler's shoes. cant even where them out anymore
"It wasn‚Äôt like my pair in 2019 these are and look so wide on my feet like bulky !! However they are super comfy like walking on clouds.

The tan part dirty super fast"
"Purchased for a family member. 1/2 size up, as recommended, was the right call. The EasyOn heel was loved and the comfort was top notch. Does have a foam outsole which may have longevity issues, but as of now this pair is comfy and incredibly easy to throw on."
"Lightweight yet super comfortable ‚Äî plenty of room in the toe box and believe it or not these Nikes make my feet look smaller!  Great buy in fact, very reasonable and I love the gold swoosh."
They feel great and are perfect for people who have accessory navicular pain (extra bone on top of the arch of foot)  I sized up a half size and would recommend sizing a full size up.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Got this for my son and he really likes it. It says he has good feel from the ball when he plays.
this cleats are so good and are good for defenders
My son chose these himself purely based on the colour and he loves them
"Excellent value. No break in period required. Great for AG/turf fields. Love the black color and the material is soft and seems to be good at repelling water from the outside. I sized up .5 or else they will be super tight. 
Also I really like the high collar as it helps to keep turf pellets out of my shoes."

I wore it for 3 days. And now its broken
"I bought these soccer turf roughly a week ago and I got them within six days of ordering them. They fit wonderfully well and comfortable. If you you are a size 9, ensure to buy an inch up (10"")."
Shoes are comfortable and light. Shipping was fast
Best shoe for medium pace games.Traction is great and foot support is good.
Shoes seem to run small. Tried three different sizes to a full size bigger and they still felt short. They also need to bring back the little kids and toddler options.
"Style and construction is nice. A bit narrow in the toe, seems 1/2 to 1 size too small, suggest ordering at least 1/2 size larger."
"The shoe has such a fun look! At first I wasn‚Äôt a fan of how the laces tied, but after some wears it actually didn‚Äôt bother me. They‚Äôre great to wear around casually but I wish they just had a little more squish to them."
"The moment I put the Nike FlyKnit Bloom‚Äôs on my feet, I knew they were pretty much everything I want in a casual shoe. The neutral color way, the sleek design, and the chunkier sole make a great first impression for someone seeking a modern, updated but functional look. As a busy toddler mom, I am always looking for a sneaker that is multi functional. I was able to wear this shoe chasing my kid around at a brewery, while shopping, enjoying a dinner date night, and taking mid-intensity walks with my family. I was able to easily pair these with leggings and joggers, as well as a wide leg tailored pant for a more casual work function; the chunky sole also gave me a height boost, which is always a must for this 5‚Äô4‚Äù gal, while also providing a ton of cushion for comfort - probably my favorite aspect of the shoe. The upper shoe is made of stretchy material that breathes really well and is almost see through on the sides. This means socks are not easily concealed, so I would recommend a white or neutral sock depending on the shoe color way. The laces have a really sleek look to them. They continue around the top of the shoe and tie at the back behind the ankle creating a great look, but they did come untied a few times. This was fixed by tying a bit tighter. Other than that, truly an amazing shoe that this busy working mom will be wearing again and again."
"The flyknit bloom was very comfortable and quite bouncy. It really fit true to size and the fabric ended up feeling of a very high quality. I also liked that it was a very lightweight shoe. Meanwhile, I wasn't a huge fan of the color of this shoe and just felt that it was kind of boring when I got the shoe in hand. I also wasn't a huge fan of the two-inch heel. One of the biggest negatives was the laces on the heel of the shoe. After wearing the shoes for a few minutes, the heel laces on one of the shoes came untied. Since the laces are on the heel, it's hard to notice if those laces are untied and that could turn into a tripping hazard. Overall, I felt that the shoe was a little bit bulky, but if the heel was cut down and there were more colorways of this specific shoe, then I'd definitely be willing to purchase another pair."
My loves these slides and says they are very comfortable. I just wish i could find a man‚Äôs 13. They are unique.
"The shoe is a comfortable shoe, however, I should have gotten a size smaller. The material is not as soft as it looks in the picture but it is comfortable. Provides great support for my arches. I‚Äôm satisfied with the shoes."
"I received mine a couple of days ago...wore them today and I love them! FYI...Red Stardust is really pink, which is fine with me. I will be purchasing Lucky Green next. They fit pretty true to size. I have a wide foot and the shoe is comfortable."
My daughter love them! She said they are so comfortable.
Just as advertised. Perfect condition. Came the next day.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought for my daughters indoor soccer games have worked great
"The Nike JR vapor 15 club AstroTurf trainers are really catching in the all black colour way.
They are a pair of trainers designwd using the move to zero initiative meaning they have been made from recycled materials.

The rubber sole is designed to allow for a lot of twisting and turning and it has a synthetic leather upper material to allow players to grip the ball and have better control of the ball when dribbling.


The rubber outsole means it can be used not only on AstroTurf but also on sports hall floors. The shoes are secured with laces which since having the phantom GX Nike trainers are easy for my 7 year old to tie due to us putting in the time and effort to teach him with those shoes.

These shoes are great but with my youngests recent growth spurt I can't see him being in them for too long due to the shoes being designed to give comfort with a padded lining and minimal stretch."
"Bought these for my son who plays football on Astro turf 4 times a week. He said they are super comfortable and loves wearing them. If you are in to plain stylish boots these are perfect. If you want to spot your son in a crowd of kids playing football, it‚Äôs a bit difficult! Have bought these before and would buy them again. They always last and never cause any pain discomfort, even when first worn."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this for my daughter she loves them good cleats
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My little athletes love their new cleats! I purchased two pair for my twins and they have raved over these shows. They particularly love the color way and have expressed that they are quite comfy while on the field! The laceless design is also a plus! Would purchase again for sure!
"These look great but after a few years they smell so bad.
Even washing them does not help.
Common problem with the mercurial shoe."
Too tight in the toe box and too loose in the heel. Not much support. Sadly not for me.
"This is my third pair of Air Max. There is not breaking in period-they fit perfectly and comfortably the first time you wear them. Wore them to work the first day for a shift that started out as a 6 hour shift and, after call offs, went to a 12 hour shift. Feet felt great. Like walking on a cloud (or what one thinks walking on a cloud should be!)"

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I wouldn't purchase these online. We had to size up by 2 sizes for my 11 year old son. Glad we went into the store to purchase or we would have had to return. Seems like a quality shoe. Won't know much about comfort or how they hold up for another few weeks once practice and games start.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We decided to buy just practice cleats for our son. Living in a rainy state this was a great choice to have 1 pair for practice.
Had to go up a size for my child...very nice shoe.
"No lace system was suspect, but so far so good. Not sure if they would be ideal for an overactive player."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Our daughter picked these out and she likes the style.
Nice lightweight football boots
"My daughter really like the color of the cleats and the style. The only issue we had was they were very narrow, and my daughter has a wide foot. If you have a narrow or regular size foot, I highly recommend this issue."
"The first outing was not successful and they felt slippy. My son kept slipping and said he wanted to return them, but the second wearing they were great. He is very comfortable and happy in them, just as well as he plays so much football! They were the same make as his last ones, he loves them so much, just changed the colour . Glad he is happy, they look great, are well made, sturdy and can withstand playing senior level football 4-5 times a week if anything like the last pair, which he grew out of and the studs started to wear down."
Very narrow toe box. The upper is not elastic. Poor job from nike to use cheaper materials but sticking to the high tier shoe design.
Perfect fit brand new love them fast delivery .
"Walking over 18,000 steps 5days a week these shoes fit my use."
"Perfect fit, true to size, light, and comfortable. I bought blue and cherry both of them."
The best airmax sneaker I have ever owned!!!! And that includes the 90s. So that's saying something
Anyone who says these are comfortable should actually buy a pair of running shoes. Only wore them twice I will try to break them in to see if they become comfy.
"These are honestly the most comfortable pair of Nikes I think I‚Äôve ever bought! I‚Äôm only disappointed with the fact there are only two color ways. I have both the grey and the black pair! I plan on buying another pair, though I would love to see an update on the color options!!!!"

"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Good shoes, held up well, but are very difficult to clean the mesh part"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Shoe true to size and the cutest on my 6yr old.. shipping was fast came right in time for Christmas
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The shoe is made wonderfully. To be honest the ONLY issue I have is the Sensor tag was left on the shoe, so my sister can‚Äôt wear her new shoes till my mom takes the shoes back to the store and asked them to remove the sensor."

Very comfy and great quality. If you‚Äôre thinking about getting these you should. Bought these for my mom she wears a size 10 and they fit perfect
just too big but great quality
I love these shoes soooo much but thing about it is the shoe Nike design that‚Äôs in the shoe it fades quickly like a couple times after you were them.Super cute tho I‚Äôm in love

"DO NOT SIZE UP like the reviews say. This shoe runs very large. I ordered my son size 11 after reading the reviews and have to return for his normal size 10. I wouldn‚Äôt even size up 1/2 a size in these, they run that big. Other than the size issue, they seem like they will be really comfortable. Nice soft material and two Velcro straps to keep the shoe snug."
"Looks great but still too small even after sizing up 1 full size. For context, I have long, narrow feet and normally wear a 9.5 in Nike shoes - the 10.5 in this cycle shoe is too small. If you have a long big toe, you may need to size up by 1 1/2 sizes."
"I made sure to read all of the reviews, they all said to size up!, DO NOT SIZE UP just get your size. I will have to size down and up because they do not have my size but the 8 was way to big, i fyou are going to size up do a half if that."

I have a heel spur and I was looking for a sneaker to help relieve the pain. These are them! So comfortable
"This shoe is quite comfortable, just like my other air series shoes. I thought this shoe would be wide, but it is very compact and well-wrapped. The size of the air cushion is not exaggerated, and the width extending outward is similar to Yeezy. The only thing that worries me is that the shoelaces of this shoe are not inserted through the plastic holes like other shoes, but are tied to the upper with some thin wires. I am afraid it will break."
"These shoes are insanely heavy. I bought these for work, I‚Äôm on my feet and walk about 6-9miles a shift. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend these for work"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought these for my youngest futsal season. Great shoe with solid touch and is comfortable to wear.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought these for my daughters indoor soccer season, they are happy with them."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Perfectly fit, light weight and comfortable fit. Not too crazy about the color but looks good!"
I have been buying Tiempo Legends (highest version) for over 13 years and they used to be great with the kangaroo leather but Nike is getting away from that and have been making them more and more synthetic. This model is by far the thinnest upper material I have had. I understand they are trying to make them lighter but I specifically stay away from vapors and other ultra light material because they have no protection thickness and now they just feel cheap on the upper compared to previous models. Extremely disappointed with Nike on these cleats. Big general Nike fan.
"My shoe size is 8.5 if you want to gift me
I would really appreciate if you gift me thank you have a good day"
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these shoes for my 11 year old son. The material is quality and very durable. Also, they are comfortable."
Great kids shoes My son loves them and they fit him perfectly!
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Almost perfect shoe. Purchased an 8, fits a little tighter than his other size 8s, so size up for more space."
Good shoe for the sale price.  Quick delivery.
"Received these cleats about 2 weeks ago and it fits my U8 girl perfectly. She says the shoe is comfortable and I really appreciate how easy it is to slip on and off of her foot (other Mom‚Äôs out there know how fun it is to be running late to practice and still struggling to put on shoes!). Being an Environmental Scientist, I love the fact that they‚Äôre earth friendly as they are made with recycled materials and as a financial savvy Mom, I also appreciate the great price point as Soccer can get really expensive! Not enough time to see how durable they are or how long they‚Äôll last but overall would recommend these shoes as a solid option for my child."
My son has tried this shoes out for a week now and says he likes them but has had better Nike cleats. They run a bit big but the fabric is forgiving so maybe that‚Äôs why. He said they are light so he feels quick in them but definitely has a preference to the Nike mercurials. I would recommend these but if you‚Äôre definitely in club soccer I would opt for the higher quality ones especially considering how much they are being used (at least 5 times a week).
These cleats were great. My kid loved them. He said they were super cool and very comfortable even to the point where he wanted to wear them as regular shoes :). Overall I would definitely purchase these in different colors if offered.
"Very good quality shoe
I‚Äôve just started playing for a Walking Football team locally. We play and train on a 3G pitch. So the good grip of the shoes is great"
"Good quality and well made for the price. Son likes the way they fit and feel, and he has wider feet. The synthetic upper is soft but the way leather stretches and forms to the foot is irreplaceable. Nike, make the Tiempo leather again."
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Good product, comfortable, gets job done. Stylish look"
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] my kid loves them. wears them to train and on game day.
Brought it for someone nice shoes but size run small
Surprisingly narrow. My daughter has had multiple iterations of this boot for years. This pair is visibly narrower. Not sure why the change in last to a more narrow one. Makes no sense- it's already a narrow boot to begin with. Only the most European of feet can fit this boot.
The shoes got easily damaged within 6 months. They are not worth it for the price.
Comfortable and stylish. Good deal.
"Cool buy,gift for my brother in law"
"Very Happy with my shoes, I own several color ways, my size is a ladies 8, I prefer to buy a mens size 7 or a youth size 7,which is a ladies 8.5,great style an value,6.5Y also fits too,for a true,ladies size 8, will  by more  color ways too."
The shows are very pretty but they crease easily and they are not accurate size they are to big
My daughter loves them and put them on immediately.

I love these! The color was exactly what I wanted and it is has been very comfortable at the gym.
"I didn‚Äôt expect to like these as much as I do. These were perfect for the purpose I bought them for which was for Apple Fitness+ lower body strength workouts. I celebrated my 250th strength workout in these and surprisingly also received the burned the most calories award so I have to believe they definitely contributed to that. I sized down to an 8 from my usual Nike size 8.5 and glad I did‚Äîthe EasyOn coupled with the Hyperlift stability plate makes it so easy to slip on/off. The grip is also phenomenal on these, I‚Äôll have no issue upping the weight going forward! No cons though note that these are absolutely not running shoes, I wouldn‚Äôt even try as they‚Äôre much too firm/blocky for that."
"So disappointed in these shoes. I‚Äôve been wearing Metcons for years and normally I love them. I bought these just a few weeks ago and have barely worn them, they already have a big rip in them. I only wear them to lift weights and didn‚Äôt do anything to rip them. The quality has gone so downhill."
"True to size, bought for grandson. He likes the way they feel."
Nice looking shoe but super narrow. Have to return and might order a whole size up

"Nice to the touch right out of the box, but sizing is not the same as legend 9 elite. Son wears men‚Äôs 11.5 in legend 9 elite and fits foot like a glove.  He could barely squeeze his foot into men‚Äôs 11.5 in legend 10 elite. Go 1/2 size up."

Absolutely üíØ Love these shoes! Great Price ‚Ä¶. Great fit!!!
These shoes are comfortable and super easy to put on. Run and get you a pair! No pun intended!
"It is very beautiful, easy to put on but I expected to be softer on the walk. It's a good cost and benefit but don't expect too much ""softness""."
Daughter loves them get lots of compliments. Very stylish and comfy turf shoe
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great indoor soccer shoes. Variety of colors but they are good fit and true to size
Good shoes they stick to your foot too
Good quality daughter loves them
Soul of shoe feel off after 4 weeks. Worst shoe ever
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love these stylish and well fitted cleats. They have a tie underneath and an elastic band on top.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] love these shoes daughter loves them they are kid proof and very durable
I bought the air max for my son he loved those sneakers they are so comfortable and the fact that is no shoelace even better I will buy this sneakers again
My son loves these shoes. He says the are the most comfortable shoes he has ever worn.
"I absolutely love the look of these shoes and wanted them to work. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing wrong, but I couldn‚Äôt get them on my foot. The ratio of the size of the shoe and my foot did not match with the size of the opening to get my foot in there. Additionally, there isn‚Äôt really any stretch around the opening very confused and sad."
"Doesn't live up to the Peg Turbo name. The scraps of Zoom X foam used is like a dense, firm, and hard version of it. They should've just named this Pegasus next nature. Those of us who ran in the previous versions of the Peg Turbo know how good a running shoe that was an this doesn't come anywhere close."
"The shoe is very comfortable.  My major complaint is the outer sole is very thin and wears fast. I am a heavy heal striker, but I wore through the  outer sole in 50 miles.  I add sheet metal screws to the corners after about 200 miles normally, so I won't buy this style again.  I've had a least 3 pairs of Pegasus every year since they came out."
i love them. They are so pretty and comfortable
These came in right on time and looked even better in person! The fit was true to size with a comfortable fit! I love the style and they are very well-made! I recommend these shoes to anyone who is looking for a good stylish pair of sneakers for men!
Comfortable casual that can handle daily adventures. Half size up from typical AM90
The comfort is what I was looking for since I am on my feet a lot also the style is different from a lot of other brands.
"Lifetime Nike customer. 30+years, never an issue with size. Sandals are too wide/my foot is too narrow. Cannot keep sandals secure. Within a few steps, toes end-up over the front of each sandal."
"The sandals looks great, but are not functional. The design is flawed. I was suspicious already reading mixed reviews about these sandals online, however I still went ahead to give it a try. The strap system and overall design is poor from functional aspect. The feet slides forward just while trying it indoors. The size of sandals is perfects to my feet and generally the shoe(Nike) size I wear mostly. Disappointed that I'll have to look another sandal before my travel starts shortly. Will be returning these sandals. And would not recommend!"
ORDERED THESE IN SIZE M7/W8 AND M8/W9 HOWEVER BOTH SIZES ARE THE SAME FIT. THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE FOR EITHER SELECTION.
Exactly in 1990s did these drop ? Looks Retro
"Good boots for my 8yr old son, only compliant is the description statement of ‚ÄúNo tie laces‚Äù, the boots come with laces and you have to tie them."

Grand son likes his shoes he is very fond of wearing air nikes
"Son really enjoys the shoe, likes the looks and most of all how light the shoe is. Great color selection, not to bright not to dull."
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] my son's spikes were delivered in less than 24 hours. Amazing!
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Got these soccer cleats as a gift for my child. Zero complaints and they look great.
"Got these in, kinda odd, not my size at all, but they fit my wife pretty close.

She said they are very comfortable, easy to slide on and decent for her orange theory workouts.

For around the house or running a quick errand they are the best.

She was a little turned off that they say they are for pregnant women."
Cleats are great besides custom name and numbers already falling off after 1 month
very convenient and comfortable for playing Soccer
"Great fit, no uncomfortable rubbing on molded parts of shoe, and easy to get on and off unlike the sock-style laceless shoes."
"My son loves these shoe! I originally got them for my son to practice soccer indoors at the Rec, but now he won‚Äôt take them off!"
"JR LEGEND 10 ACADEMY IC 

These shoes are a big kids dream! The cushion and fit is definitely something to rave about. It can be worn all day morning to afternoon. It is extremely comfortable. The design makes the shoe appear very athletic almost like soccer shoes. The design is the best part of the shoe. Highly recommend for any child in need of a comfortable, athletic and cool, looking shoe overall!"

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Son loves these. nice fit and gold swoosh is awesome he says. Lightweight shoes. very comfortable!
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these a few weeks ago I think their amazing I would recommend

"Stylish, very comfortable, super speedy delivery too,"
"I got this pair for my husband it feet very well and he likes it ,highly recommended"
"I purchased these in Womens 7.5 and I they look like kids, so small!!!"
"Terrible Astro. Boot. Bought my boy 2 pairs (his size and the next size up) both ruined in no time from just playing football at school. Grip is minimal, the the leather upper scuffs and rips easily. The limited grip wears super fast and results in holes.. had plenty of astros to do the same job as there two pairs and all have been much better! Would avoid."
"Excellent soccer shoe for both indoor snd outdoor soccer. My daughter is 9 and wore them for the first time this morning during her game and loved them. She said they made her run faster.. lol.  The look of these is great, I love the black, easy to clean and looked great  after the game even full of grass.."
Fits perfectly. Holds up during training

"These are the stiffest shoes ever.  I love the look, but they are soo hard and stiff, inside and out..."
Another amazing shoe for everyday use. Couldn‚Äôt be happier with the quality and performance.
I been wear Nike Infity React now from 2 to now react 4 ( over 10 pairs) and absolutely obsessed. I do a lot of power walking and also every day I work out and I have never had this comfortable shoe in my life. Nike react4 is different than normal sizing I usually wear a tennis shoe in size 8 this one I had to get it in 8.5. You just can‚Äôt go wrong with these. I never wore tennis shoes other than for workout but now since they make this look so good I wear them everywhere and I get multiple pairs at the time.
"Love them so much. I love running. That's why I needed this buddy to be with me. I also purchased Invincible 3, but these shoes are perfect for my feet. And they looked stylish too. I love pink. I got the pink ones for me. It motivated me to run. ^^"

Good quality indoor / outdoor option.
"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Perfect indoor turf shoe. Such great quality. Solid, will last a long time!"
"My daughter and I love this shoe (boot). Previously my daughter's laces would always get undone during a match, and it always seemed to happen during an important play. Now, she has one less thing to worry about."
Bought these for my 8 year old. Her favorite color is purple and she loves them!
Bought for my Son they are true to size and he said they‚Äôre really comfortable
Bought for my wife for her to wear at her job for nhs she loves how light yet comfortable and supportive they are
Spot on my son likes some even more so because you don‚Äôt have to tie the laces
The all black does not look quality. You can see the glue seeping from the edges ????? Not happy Nike
I bought this for my son and he loves his trainers
