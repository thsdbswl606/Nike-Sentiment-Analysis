Also, grab a pair of quality laces, because these are sooooooo thin!  Speaking of thin, the cloth material of the heel is much too thin, and I doubt it will hold up for long.

I ordered them because of the hands free slip-on feature, and that seems to work well, but I haven't made up my mind whether to try a bigger size or just send them back. I'm so disappointed. But my needs are not universal. If you don't need additional arch support or cushioning, and if you can get the size right, then this could be a great shoe for you. I will say that the green color is a little brighter and more attractive in person than it was online, so there's that.\", 'Go up a size.

At first I wasn’t a fan of how the laces tied, but after some wears it actually didn’t bother me. They’re great to wear around casually but I wish they just had a little more squish to them.', 'The moment I put the Nike FlyKnit Bloom’s on my feet, I knew they were pretty much everything I want in a casual shoe. The neutral color way, the sleek design, and the chunkier sole make a great first impression for someone seeking a modern, updated but functional look. As a busy toddler mom, I am always looking for a sneaker that is multi functional. I was able to wear this shoe chasing my kid around at a brewery, while shopping, enjoying a dinner date night, and taking mid-intensity walks with my family. I was able to easily pair these with leggings and joggers, as well as a wide leg tailored pant for a more casual work function; the chunky sole also gave me a height boost, which is always a must for this 5’4” gal, while also providing a ton of cushion for comfort - probably my favorite aspect of the shoe. The upper shoe is made of stretchy material that breathes really well and is almost see through on the sides. This means socks are not easily concealed, so I would recommend a white or neutral sock depending on the shoe color way. The laces have a really sleek look to them. They continue around the top of the shoe and tie at the back behind the ankle creating a great look, but they did come untied a few times. This was fixed by tying a bit tighter. Other than that, truly an amazing shoe that this busy working mom will be wearing again and again.', \"The flyknit bloom was very comfortable and quite bouncy. It really fit true to size and the fabric ended up feeling of a very high quality. I also liked that it was a very lightweight shoe. Meanwhile, I wasn't a huge fan of the color of this shoe and just felt that it was kind of boring when I got the shoe in hand. I also wasn't a huge fan of the two-inch heel. One of the biggest negatives was the laces on the heel of the shoe. After wearing the shoes for a few minutes, the heel laces on one of the shoes came untied. Since the laces are on the heel, it's hard to notice if those laces are untied and that could turn into a tripping hazard. Overall, I felt that the shoe was a little bit bulky, but if the heel was cut down and there were more colorways of this specific shoe, then I'd definitely be willing to purchase another pair.\"]\n",

My pair sometimes hurt the upper part of my left foot near the top lacing area, but gets a little better when I mess with lacing, or loosen them up.

They feel good—nice plush insides. \\n\\nI only rated the shoe 4 out of 5 because the insoles started to move inside the shoe. Maybe it's because I have sweaty feet. I wear stance socks so they absorb moisture. But the insoles constantly move when I'm exercising for more than 2 hours at a time. \\n\\nI use these shoes mainly to play pickleball.

Ideal for a neutral runner, but  brilliant for those in need of stability. So much cushion for long runs. Thats generic across all models. The 4th edition carries on with this. The only complaint is the extra weight and thicker upper means they’re warmer and slower. They also run a half size small, which is unusual for Nike.

They last 4 months, nike was nice enough to send ne a replacement but the same thing happened. \\n\\nI saw they made a new version. SFB B2 they removed the rubber little squares that fall off anyway and added a pull tab. If they put regular boot eyelets on a new SFB B3 version I would give 5 stars.\\n-I only use these when I'm in the schoolhouse so no field work and they still failed.

As an active duty member of the US Army, I rely heavily on the quality and durability of my footwear, and unfortunately, the Nike SFB B1 boots have fallen far short of my expectations.\\n\\nHaving been a loyal customer of Nike for many years, I was confident in the brand's reputation for producing high-quality products. However, the recent experience with these boots has left me questioning the standards of craftsmanship and durability that Nike upholds.\\n\\nWithin just six months of purchase, I have encountered numerous quality issues with these boots that are simply unacceptable. Despite only using them for everyday office wear, the boots have already started to deteriorate. The lace holding component, which is crucial for securing the boots, wore through and failed due to poor construction, rendering the boots unusable. Additionally, the rubber siding has begun to detach and the seams on the sides have ripped, all after minimal wear.\\n\\nAs someone who relies on dependable footwear for both professional and personal use, experiencing such rapid deterioration in a pair of boots is both frustrating and inconvenient.\\n\\nAs an active duty member of the US Army, I expect my equipment, including footwear, to withstand the demands of my duties. The Nike SFB B1 boots have failed to meet this expectation, and I am deeply disappointed by their lack of durability and quality.\\n\\nI am open to considering alternative Nike footwear options that may offer better quality and durability. However, I urge Nike to take immediate action to address the issues with the Nike SFB B1 boots to prevent other customers and Soldiers from experiencing similar dissatisfaction.\", 'As a member of the army I loved these boots, they felt like running shoes.

The fit and feel are generally comfortable, offering a nice, lightweight sensation. However, the difficulty in putting them on is a notable drawback, especially for sizes 2C, 3C, and 4C.

Nevertheless, the stiff pull tab for the heel poses a challenge, particularly given the broader shape of a baby's foot.\\n\\nThe fabric used is breathable and lightweight, contributing to overall comfort. However, the inclusion of a foamy sole adds unnecessary weight for a baby that isn't walking yet, making the shoes feel somewhat clunky.\\n\\nOverall, I appreciate the look and feel of the shoes, but for a baby, the difficulty in putting them on and the clunky feel due to the foamy sole are areas that could be improved.

They are ultralite (6.5oz in my size) and have a super wide toebox, which is unlike most Nike products. This means that you’re not gonna get any pressure on your toenails and they’re not hitting up against the front of the shoe.

I don’t know how this shoe would do on super technical terrain, considering it is a race shoe, so it’s meant to be fast and agile. But I don’t know if it would protect you from kicking a rock or hitting a rock with anything near your ankle. You’re definitely gonna feel that. I’m all in for taking this on my next race and super excited to see how I perform in this shoe.

There is a huge loop on each sneaker, which an adult finger can fit through (really thoughtful and appreciated!!) but even with that aid, we had quite a bit of trouble getting the sneakers on.\\n\\nOnce they are on, though, they\\'re super stylish and our son reports they\\'re very comfortable. We have the gray and white and it looks great. We are happy with the way they fit and look and he is happy with the way they feel. The only real drawback is how difficult they are to put on.', 'As a sneakerhead I have tried to buy my 4 year old every type of Nike and Jordan shoe under the sun but they always have something that doesn\\'t work, they hurt his feet, they are hard for him to get on, they are hard for me to get on him and so when I  got the Flex Runner 3 PS I was skeptical but boy was I wrong this is a great shoe that he can put on himself and allows him to be as active as he wants. They are stretchy so they are easy to put on, light but not too light and a great amount of cushioning that is very responsive or to quote him \"I think they might even be too bouncy\" they were not in fact too bouncy. I highly recommend this shoe especially for kids with wider feet or difficulty putting on their shoes, these are now his go to pair and I get to see a Check on the side of his foot instead of Daniel Tiger.']\n",

Most of the features found on the 3.0 have stayed largely the same, but some changes I’ve noticed include a quilted ripstop upper now with a parallelogram- or diamond-shaped pattern instead of the previous triangle-shaped pattern on the 3.0, a revised heel strap that now sits more flush with the shoe, a change to the front mudguard now being made of what feels like a synthetic suede, and more use of Nike’s recycled \"Grind\" rubbers on the front and rear portions of the outsole. There do not appear to be any visible changes to the outsole traction pattern.\\n \\nOutside of those changes, the ACG Moc 3.5 continues to be a great, versatile slip-on shoe (thus the “moc” name) that’s comfortable to be used for a wide-variety of casual uses, including running errands around town or lounging around the house (or around a campfire). Its cushioning is a touch on the firmer end but not overly so, and its light weight thanks to its construction materials means my feet don’t experience any fatigue after long days wearing them. The 3.5 is also pretty easy to clean thanks to its ripstop upper, so it can definitely be used in wetter weather. This is NOT a hiking or performance shoe and should not be used for such purposes. \\n\\nSo, all in all, the ACG Moc 3.5 is a great, all around lounging/house shoe that is easy to slip on, fairly durable, and stays comfortable to wear for hours.']\n",
